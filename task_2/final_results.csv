"The argument: 'I second the legal aspect. While a financial abortion seems fair in theory, it would be a nightmare in practice. If a woman gets pregnant, she typically finds out two weeks later. But what if she sometimes has a late period or otherwise doesn't think about it? She may not find out for a month or more. Then she has to send a legal form to the father to see if he'll want to support her financially. What if he's out of town? What if he *claims* that he never received it? This could be several months' worth of hassle, at which point the woman may no longer be able to abort, either legally or for health reasons. She may also be against aborting for ethical reasons, since many people believe that aborting a fetus that's a couple weeks old is very different than a fetus that's a few months old. And finally, all of this would put the woman under considerable stress, which is absolutely the last thing that we want to do to a pregnant woman.'.

Since the government hasn't really made any move to censor any type of speech, your fears are largely unfounded and the only censorship exists through social pressure.

"The argument: 'If you're a good parent then your goal is to set your child up with the knowledge and skills necessary to have the best possible chance at a successful life. Making sure that your child understands the value of hard work and of a dollar is one of those tools, but making sure that they obtain a first rate education is a more important one. On top of that, the drawbacks present in a parents-not-paying situation are much much greater than the drawbacks for parents paying. Worst case scenario if parents don't pay is the kid grows up a little jaded and takes longer to learn the value of a dollar and his education if at all. The potential drawbacks for parents not paying are that the kid doesn't get an education at all, must work at lower wages than he would have had the potential to earn, and lives a much less happy life than he could have had if his parents had paid. Sure he'll learn the important lesson of how he should have budgeted his time better and how he should have did this or that, but how does that benefit him? He'll be able to spend his eternally much lower funds on more sensible things? Worst case scenario if you pay for your kid is they come out of college a bit aloof and spend too much money on entertainment. Worse case scenario if you don't pay for your kids is they have a lifetime of regrets from what they were unable to do and have a lifetime of limited earning potential. As an aside, this exact situation happened to my mom. She had rich parents who paid for her first year of college and told her to cover the rest even though they could afford the expense without giving it a second thought. She completed her first year with great grades and then got scared and left. She didn't understand loans, and so she got a job at McDonalds.

If that's known to be a thing which happens, it would grind markets to a halt. Everyone would assume that everyone else was trading on future knowledge, and wouldn't want to make trades at all. Of course every lottery and casino and other betting thing would also need to shut down. You can't bet on horse races if someone can hop back after its done.

Even though I could very clearly show that it would drastically lower highway fatalities. Because there's more to it than that. It's not just about what ""works"".

"The argument: '&gt;Trump's comments were attacking her personally, and he never attacked her gender, he simply mentioned it. Yes, but the DNC's response encompasses more than just those specific remarks.

What also must be considered is the context of the adjectives he chose. [Crazy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/07/09/men-really-need-to-stop-calling-women-crazy/) is becoming recognized as a word that is often uniquely used to describe women, in a way it isn't always used to describe men. The word itself is not inherently tied to a given gender, but in context, the word is very frequently used with that slant. *** The DNC, in response to Trump's comments, made a broader statemtent about Trump's mysoginy, calling both these specific remarks and the past actions of himself and his party mysogynistic together. If you look at the words that Trump used in a vaccum, then I'd agree that these remarks were not tacitly mysoginistic. However, if you take into account the recent history of Trump and his party, as well as the social context for the specific vocabulary he used, the DNC has a very strong argument that the comments were mysoginistic. &gt;Would it have been sexist for him to call a man a 'highly neurotic man'? This statement, on the other hand, lacks the context mentioned above - Trump and Republicans have not historically stood against male interests, nor do the words used there have any sort of association, cultural or literal, with gender.

Third, this increases drug use rates, including hard drugs. You mentioned Portugal, but the years following the Portuguese decriminalization of drugs saw an huge increase in cocaine and heroin use. If you legalize ALL drugs, you're going to see an increase in drug use and an increase in addicts. The standard for making a decision in this situation has to be quality of life. Decriminalizing every drug is going to put more people on the streets, create new addicts, and kill more people through overdoses. And for what? Some extra tax revenue and to make the cartels lose a little money? Side note: The reason Portugal chose to legalize is because AIDS was particularly virulent in Portgual. Decriminalization brought drugs out of the shadows, and allowed them to use clean needles.

And there are simply too many gender identities for anyone to reasonably expect you to know or actively serve them all, even if they weren't constantly expanding.

You seem to have an understandable misconception about the basic definitions here. Your proposal that male/female should be sufficient is slightly off. And a lot can be cleared up by distinguishing this. Sex = biology, gender = identity. Sex is the physical body you were born with/have. Remember biology class? XX and XY chromosomes? There is also xxy. There are also ambiguous genitalia. It ends up being a social distinction, but the physical differences can have real world repercussions. (Do we have enough bathrooms to accommodate? In case of emergency, what do we tell emergency services? What are we required to do legally?) So for sex, it comes down to 3 options for most reasonable people. Male, female, and intersex. Those are the only ones you should see on 97% of forms. Gender is just about how you identify yourself. That's where the disconnect comes from because it isn't tied to anything physical. So to those that don't have any interest in the issue, it seems insane to have that many genders. When it comes to gender, these are typically included for data analytics purposes and in real life for social interaction. The biggest issue is language. If you aren't sure about gender, and are talking to or about them, ask for ""preferred pronouns"". If you are corrected, just to with it.

But once you reach that point, the people who would have called you a bigot will probably be calling you a racist or a homophobe instead as people tend to gravitate towards the more specific word anyway. And those words are just as likely, if not moreso, to induce rage in listeners. Bigot exists more as a catch-all phrase for those situations when someone is extremely intolerant, but there isn't really a more specific word that can be used to describe them.'.

"The argument: 'There's too much variance in the ways different teachers grade let alone the way other people perceive those grades. My HS geometry teacher was primarily a football coach, first and foremost. He allowed and even encouraged us to use our notes on tests and quizzes. Our class was more about ability to take notes than it was about understanding geometry and you'd be a fool not to get at least a B. By contrast, my HS Precal teacher was the only one in the school that wouldn't let us use a note card with the equations on it for tests. Not only did we need to know how to use equations, we had to have them memorized. An A in my geometry class would be about as valuable as an F in any other and a D in my precal class could be worth an A-B in another class. This is why a lot of teachers hate letter grades. It's because it's a poor system of reflecting a student's understanding of subject matter entirely. It's not that grades are too inflated, it's that radically different teaching styles provide too much opportunity for grades to be meaningless. As an extreme example, I could take a math class where everything I did for the year was worth 1% of my grade and I could earn the full 1% through A's on all homework assignments, tests, and quizzes. Then I have an emergency causing me to lose sleep and miss breakfast for the final test and I end up getting a 70 on it, just barely passing. By all rights, I should be an A student but because of one slip up on one assignment I'm a C student. By contrast, someone who never showed up to class and cheated on the last day to get a 100 on the test would look like the smartest kid in class with a total mastery of subject matter. In other words the problem has less to do with the way people perceive grades and more to do with how they're administered. Officials have tried to make this better through standardized testing, but this discourages teachers from being inventive and makes classes dull, still negatively affecting grades. There isn't really an easy answer here.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

If you feel like you're not cool or attractive enough to ask out the girl of your dreams then that's too bad but the school can't really be blamed for certain kids having a lack of confidence. It's stress that's entirely self imposed, yet you blame the existence of this option the school is providing you to go out and dance. But the solution isn't to remove the option, it's to remove the stress. Stop caring so much, because you're going to have to sooner or later. It's moments like these that coax kids into coming out of their shells and that dictate the type of adults they will one day become, and you should be thankful for the opportunity. As backwards as that sounds, it's going to be even more embarrassing when you're in college, or worse when you've graduated college, and can't muster up the courage to ask someone out that you're super attracted to and who you believe may like you back. It's not as if one day you grow up and all of the sudden the courage you lacked in middle/high school floods into you so that you can finally live your life unhindered. You have to take little baby steps to unlock the potential already within you and these moments are how you do that. But of course it's perfectly fine to just not go, or to go with just friends, or a girl you might not be attracted to but who you like hanging out with (assuming there aren't any misconceptions about the nature of your relationship on either side). When you learn to loosen up at one of these events, you will also have fun and they'll stop being stressful to you. I promise Source: I was a fat nerdy loser who was too scared to ask anyone I liked to go to any school hosted social functions and didn't blossom until well after I should have because of it.

Logging on and reading that 20 people disliked the cute new puppy you got is going to be just as disheartening as finding out that 20 people liked your status about your previous dog dying miserably young. The fact is, the amount of people that abuse the like button are probably going to number about the same amount as the people who would abuse the dislike button, so in other words, not many.

All the time we'd get calls about a leaky pipe and a guy would volunteer to drive 2 hours out and 2 hours back on the clock so he could take 2 seconds to twist a valve and be done with it. While still a necessary component of a good worker's job, it would make much more sense for them to simply schedule the fix around the next time they were required to go out there. This is essentially the equivalent of Rooney's thinking. It's practically a day off for him, shirking his otherwise more demanding responsibilities to act as a truancy officer going on a house visit and still get paid to do it. It's not uncommon for students to miss a day and even if that does happen, the appropriate response is to send a truancy officer to check it out if you believe there to be a situation, not to lay everything else on your plate aside to go fix one tiny problem.

"The argument: 'The EEOC actually prevents employers from discriminating against someone based on criminal history as long as the crime the person was convicted of has nothing to do with the job at hand. So for example a misdemeanor jaywalking charge shouldn't prevent anyone from getting a job ever unless it's for something really specific like maybe a crossing guard position. If a job doesn't involve driving all day then past speeding misdemeanors shouldn't prevent you from getting that job. The same goes for discrimination, the EEOC are the guys that prevent people from discriminating based on race. If we didn't have a race box then people could look at two applications, one for the underqualified Steve Smith and one for the highly qualified Keshawn Jackson and throw out the one for Keshawn, knowing it would likely be for a black candidate. If Keshawn tried to report them to the EEOC, the business could feign innocence since he never indicated he was black. Sort of similar situation for criminal history. Employers do background checks anyway, which will turn up all instances of crimes regardless of what is indicated on the application. If a person doesn't put down a crime, a business can theoretically throw out their application after the background check and the applicant has less of a leg to stand on when accusing them of throwing it out because of the crime. A lot of times the race and criminal history box actually helps protect the employee from discrimination by giving them recourse to report violations to the EEOC when a business does try to act prejudiced.'.

"The argument: 'I'll preface this with the fact that I follow traditional sports a great deal, and esports not at all... ""Competitive gaming"" is analogous to ""esports"". I think everyone understands that the e- prefix suggests the clear difference between this activity and what one would naturally consider a sport. That is, the contests are performed electronically on a shared screen or multiple screens, either in person or over the Internet. The *sports* part of it- other than it being more marketable than ""competitive gaming""- is probably more useful to signify the organization and scope of what it has become. Rather than living room battles of friend vs friend, it has grown to vast leagues and tournaments, with carefully structured teams and large prizes. The audience, too, is much different. It is no longer the friends waiting their turn in on your couch, but tens of thousands of people packed into arenas or otherwise watching online.

"The argument: 'I'm going to assume you're talking (primarily) about the republican primary debates, given the timing of your question. I think that the term ""debate"" is a bit of a misnomer. What the debate actually does is give the public a forum where they can see where candidates stand on an issue. It's one of the only times where a moderator will be in control of a situation, and can continually return to a candidate when they don't give a full answer (which couldn't be enforced in the essay format). The idea that the debates just give ""soundbite answers"" may be true, but I think that's still helpful. I don't want to know every detail of Jeb!'s plan for countering ISIS, but understanding, in a broad sense, what his strategy would be is something I can do during a debate. This is good because even if they did give perfect plans for what they would do, the situation would change by the time they are actually president, so understanding the underlying philosophy behind their decisions is more important, and something that happens during a debate. Would I like to see the candidates publish essays on their positions? Absolutely! I think that it would be a more in depth debate. But just because that would be better, doesn't mean a debate has no value. They are, realistically, the cliff notes of those essays, so just a slightly less valuable version of your essay alternative. The idea that a president doesn't need to know how to debate might be true, but demonstrating an ability to think on their feet, quickly recall and apply facts, and have an evolving discussion that they can remain control of is important. All of those things are done in a debate. Be it in discussions with other world leaders, his/her own government, or the press, the ability to act with composure and grace is important to maintaining some kind of credibility for the president.

Sucks now, but the point that you'll appreciate it when you're older still holds true. When you're older, looking younger will make you more appealing to a wider variety of dating prospects as the average person that has age restrictions only cares that you ARE a certain age, not that you look it, and looking younger is more of a benefit than a disadvantage when dating later in life.

I don't think a single CMV response will flip your view 180 degrees, but here's some thoughts I can offer: When I was 15, I kind of agreed with you. Relationships were exhausting and expensive, and I was perfectly happy staying home all day and not tying my happiness and hopes to a romantic partner. I'm 21 now, and my thoughts have changed a lot since then. I have a few very close friends (and, trust me, relationships with close friends can be tiring and draining of resources both physical and monetary), and - even after a few no-strings-attached hookups at school - I fully hope to date seriously in the near future and maybe get married someday. The thing is, all of what you're saying is largely true. At the moment, I can focus a lot on my schoolwork (especially given it's internship application season!) to a degree where a significant other might impede my studies. I can hook up with whoever I want, provided of course that they want to hook up with me in return. Hell, the few times I've slept in the same bed as somebody, it's been incredibly uncomfortable, and I relish having a single-occupancy room this year.

It's kind of an inexplicable emotion (hence so many artists trying to express it), but in the context of your CMV I'd describe it as such: If you're in a really, really good romantic relationship with somebody, you realize that all these advantages you get from being single go out the window - and yet you're thrilled to remain in the relationship. It might not be wholly rational to give up the pleasures of single life, but then again we as humans are hardly ever fully rational. Emotional fulfillment in terms of a romantic partner is a wonderful feeling, and - especially if you adopt a less utilitarian view of women than the one presented in your CMV - oftentimes",[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],7.0,True,True,General,"Self-direction: thought,Universalism: nature"

"The argument: '&gt; Reddit has a strong anti-Israel view in general. Being anti-Hitler isn't the same as being a Germanophobe. &gt; In nearly every Israel thread people call the Israeli government Nazis. And rightfully so. It's a genocidal State, invading a place that was rightfully from someone else. Even an Israeli minister used the term [Lebensraum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum#Modern_usage). Some former Israeli soldier said something along the lines of ""and then I realized, **we** were the Nazis"". Sure, they are way less brutal within their borders, and in theory a liberal democracy. But for the Palestinians, they are no less brutal. Now, I don't advocate the invasion of the current State of Israel. It would do much more harm than good at this point.

"The argument: 'What your *actual* view seems to be (as opposed to what you put in the title) is that the people we characterize as fundamentalists have a more correct interpretation than those we characterize as moderates. Those are two distinct positions: the one in your title presumes that there is an identifiable, objectively correct, literal interpretation that fundamentalists are more close to; the one you actually hold is that a fundamentalist interpretation is more plausible to you than a moderate one. If your actual view was what you put in the title, it should be enough to say that every word spoken, written or signed in the history of communication has been subject to interpretation and that words written thousands of years ago in different languages and in entirely different contexts can only be understood through interpretation. Applying lessons from those texts to modern issues *unequivocally requires* a great deal of interpretation; you're applying those lessons to issues involving objects and concepts for which those languages *didn't even have words*. (For instance, how would an ancient scribe write that the Earth was 15 billion years old when he had no words to either say or conceptualize what a ""billion"" was? Should we fault him for not including that?) So there is no proper literal interpretation that you can refer to because there really is no way to apply anything without interpreting it to fit a modern context. There's no getting around that. The WBC is interpreting just as much as any moderate; except WBC doesn't try to extrapolate a philosophical meaning that they then apply to their lives, they just try to find whatever situation in the Bible that they think is similar to their current circumstance and apply away. So instead of trying to figure out the purpose of Jesus' message and the effect it was meant to have, they think ""there's gays now, and God got mad at some gays in Leviticus so...God Hates Fags!"" A moderate Christian might instead look at that same passage and think ""well that doesn't jive with the things Jesus said.""

"The argument: 'My uncle serves in the UK military and, although I don't agree with the wars in the Middle East, I have the utmost respect for him. He came from a background which was pretty bleak in terms of prospects, and signed up at 16 with no qualifications. Were it not for the army, he could have ended up in a perpetuating lifestyle where he had no job and nowhere to go, with no direction. He chose the army to escape this. Your argument is incredibly snobby looking at the qualifications thing... They join the army to make something of themselves, and would be no different if they chose to somehow get more qualifications that they missed in school. What would you prefer? For them to not join the army and be on the dole? If you don't respect their profession, at least respect that a lot of them chose to do it to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and make something of themselves. I'm sure you have respect for somebody who has done that in a civilian setting. Besides, you're making a blanket statement to say they all are. The officer classes of the army actually require qualifications from school in order to enroll. The morality issue can be taken in all sorts of directions, not least the invaders in a foreign land argument. However, what you have to understand is because people join up to make something of themselves they cannot get at home, they join wars that they have no technical say in. They become victims of circumstance. Of course they voluntarily signed up, but it's luck of the draw. Some people sign up and find that they do their stint on some foreign base somewhere, cushty as anything (my uncle did a stint in Cyprus, said he had to patrol a bit, then hit the bars), and some see frontline combat straight away.

"The argument: '1) Arguments are infinitely more persuasive when they are dismissed without rebuttal and silenced. 2) Extremism is born in isolation. Persuant to 1) It's clear that your concern here is that /r/coontown could be used to recruit or propagate racist points of view and this is obviously a real possibility. Given free reign, a sufficiently persuasive user from there could come in to CMV, convince people that there views were correct and recruit an impressionable new racist. They could funnel all sorts of folks to their sub and recruit all sorts of alienated young white people to their cause. Of course, their success in doing so would depend on the inability of anybody else in the area to articulate a better and more persuasive argument. That really cuts to the heart of why banning any sort of ""hate speech"" is ultimately a bad idea: you abandon the ideological field and claim victory even though the other side is still strong and far from defeated. This has three major consequences: the arguments against racist points of view are no longer articulated, the arguments in favor of racism become mysterious and powerful and there is the *subtle* implication that you don't actually have a good argument against racism. What that all means is that banning the speech leaves you unable to confront or inoculate against ideas that will always have an appeal to the right people at the right time. There will always be alienated, angry young men looking for a fringe culture or ideology to find an identity; often they deliberately try to find the most dangerous and mysterious culture they can. If you keep those young men from seeing honest discourse between racists and non-racists, you risk having them reject the anti-racist platitudes they were taught in favor of the novel, dangerous and apparently flawless racist arguments. To put it more simply, banning hate speech is meek laziness on the part of those who oppose the sentiments the speech carries. It's an abdication of their responsibility to vigorously oppose those ideas and to maintain good arguments in favor of their position.

"The argument: 'Imagine that you're a lawyer who works as a prosecutor. You spend your day dealing with the law, which has specific standards of evidence. You know that hearsay evidence cannot (generally speaking) be used and that a judge may disallow the introduction of evidence that aims to impugn the character of the defendant instead of speaking to the facts of the case. You understand the need for those rules of evidence and you don't believe they should ever be compromised. But when you go home, do you apply those same standards of evidence? Do you refuse to believe that your wife loves you until she presents you with a series of blood tests that show higher levels of oxytocin when you're around her? If your wife tells you that your son was sent home from school for punching another kid, do you demand surveillance footage proving he punched the kid before you believe it? My point is that most of us are willing to entertain multiple sets of rules for viewing truth in the world. We do this because each individual system of rules fails to answer certain questions we have. If I want an answer to the question ""why are we here?"", science can describe in great detail the physical processes that led to my existence. What it can't give me is meaning. To get that meaning, I use different standards of evidence. I entertain unfalsifiable claims that I would never accept out of science. I entertain my intuition and emotions as admissible evidence.

Just consider all the religious and secular schisms in history. (You could even argue that moral relativism, being as lazy at it is, has less potential to jeopardise public discourse than a strong absolutist position because ""that's just your opinion man"" is effectively bailing out of the conversation, leaving those with a strong stand/position to continue debating. Differing absolutists positions however seem to have the further potential to come to blows and war, which only might be justified as the case may be, but really jeopardises public discourse.)

"The argument: 'Historically speaking, the deadliest point in a battle is in the retreat. When you hear stories of ancient battles with lopsided casualties, it's tempting to imagine that one side were better warriors and the others were weaklings, but the truth is that a retreat leaves you vulnerable to the full force of an enemy that doesn't have to worry half as much about your fighting back. Empires can fall in one undisciplined retreat. Washington managed a truly impressive number of well-managed, disciplined retreats that kept his army in the field and the British in pursuit. Was he a brilliant offensive strategist? No, his strategies were overly complicated and relied on drilled European-style regulars he just didn't have. Did he have to be a great offensive strategist? No. All he had to do was exhaust the British and keep them deployed so long that the country became more trouble to keep than it was worth. You speak of British incompetence, but none of that would have happened unless those British armies had been in the field chasing the likes of Washington. Washington kept men from deserting, handled logistics when Congress dropped the ball (they basically told him to steal from locals, he knew better). His accomplishment was in taking a bunch of men who weren't soldiers, turning them into a nominally functional army dangerous enough to demand attention and keep them from deserting long enough to complete the job. He also won quite a few decisive victories, including the endgame at Yorktown. Given what he had to work with, what else would you hope for? Could there have been a general who would've turned those same men into an army capable of beating the British consistently in the open field? It that person had existed, he would have made Napoleon look like a nerd playing Starcraft. Calibrate your expectations to what was possible. &gt;Washington was only elected President because he was the closest thing any Americans had come to see as a leader. He also refused much more power, including repeated offers of absolute executive authority for life.

He replies: *""The water is licensed to a rancher downstream, so you're stealing water from him.""* This still seems odd because A) the handful I drink is not going to hurt the rancher, and B) why is it that this rancher gets to buy what would otherwise be freely available for his exclusive use?

There is such a thing as objectively good and bad maths, good and bad science, and so on. I am pretty sure that even you believe this. If you didn't believe this you wouldn't get on a plane and trust it not to fall out of the sky. The same is true of ethics. As a social species we need rules in order to function effectively, and there are objectively good and bad rules. A right is just a special kind of rule that applies universally and unconditionally for all humans.

"The argument: 'In my opinion, this conflict arises from a failure to differentiate between contextual connotations of the word ""responsible"". What the word itself boils down to is the assumption of agency; if you have control over something, you are responsible for it in some sense. You could then break that down into two types of responsibilities: obligatory and elective. Obligatory responsibilities are those that are inherently yours. They're matters in which you do or should have the primary force of agency. Paying your bills, eating, breathing, drinking...all of these could be considered obligatory responsibilities. To be irresponsible in this sense is to neglect what you *need* to have control over, because failing to take that control will inherently result in negative consequences. Elective responsibilities are those that you take on to gain more control of your life. You might argue that the taking on of these responsibilities signifies a more mature person, but they are different from the obligatory responsibilities in that they often deal with your agency contending with that of others. Locking your doors at night, keeping valuables out of sight in your car, carrying a gun, not losing track of your drink at a frat party...all of these could be considered elective responsibilities. Being irresponsible in this sense means to neglect what would be *prudent* for you to have control over, because failing to take that control leaves you subject to the agency of others. When people conflate these two types of responsibility, there's a problem. Being irresponsible in the obligatory case is to invite entirely predictable consequences; you are accountable for failure to fulfill your obligatory responsibilities. Being irresponsible in the elective case only puts you at risk. You are not accountable for the actions of others that take advantage of your irresponsibility. We might say you were being irresponsible if you left a MacBook Air in plain view in Baltimore, but that doesn't mean you're accountable for its theft. So while a woman at a frat party who takes drinks from random strangers may be acting irresponsibly, her agency does not determine her rape later that night.

"The argument: 'I'm going to assume you aren't a troll and take this seriously for a minute. I'm a Christian who disagrees with everything you just said. &gt;and real observable science will always show that the Earth is young like the Bible (which is **literal** and inerrant) clearly says. The Bible is not meant to be taken in its entirety as literal. I can show that by pointing out that it isn't all written as historical narrative. The Gospels are narrative historical accounts. Psalms is a book of poetry. Most of the New Testament consists of instructive letters written by apostles within specific temporal and cultural contexts. Revelation is apocalyptic allegory. The Pentateuch is a foundation myth/history (somewhere in between would be my guess) for the Jewish people. Considering that each book of the Bible had been treated as a separate entity by Christians for a long time before there was a Bible to speak of, I think treating all of them the same is nonsensical. Reading Genesis as a metaphor and/or highly simplified explanation of the creation of the Universe is much more logically consistent than denying science. Reading Original Sin as a metaphor for the birth of free will (i.e. eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil) is more logically consistent than saying that because Adam &amp; Eve ate an apple I'm condemned to death and sin. I know of no science that suggests the Earth is young. What little I've seen that claimed to be that science was actually just an embarrassing attempt to poke holes in actual science by insecure Christians who decided science was wrong because it corrected itself when it screwed up. I think modern Christians could learn something from them.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'Your thesis statement is apparently contradicted by your last statement: &gt;I have pretty much zero sympathy for people (in contemporary times) who voluntarily signed up for the military and return home with PTSD. CMV. &gt;I am not saying that their mental health problems are any more or less awful than those people who suffer from PTSD from any other type of traumatic event. I appreciate that what our veterans go through is horrific and their subsequent problems are very real. I won't go into detail, but when I compare the experiences you describe about your life (I checked your history as you invited me to do), a large part of me thinks that your problems are nothing next to those of some of the guys I know with severe PTSD. You were never shot at or mortared for hours. Your vehicle never exploded under you, killing your friends. You've never faced a persistent risk of death for months on end. It is impossible to be cognizant of the risks incurred when you go to war, that's why primarily young men with little life experience do it. I can tell you that you risk death, but you can't prepare for that risk if you've never faced it. I can tell you you'll see horrible things, but you can't prepare for that until you see them. For my part, I thought I was psychologically prepared for combat. I'd seen war movies and YouTube videos of actual combat and it didn't look that bad. Actual combat was a physiological and psychological experience unlike anything I have ever felt. Seeing people wounded, killed and mutilated was similar. I thought I would be able to compartmentalize and ignore it, and I was wrong.

"The argument: '&gt;While he was talking about it the way in which it was approached the idea of witnessing came off as an attempted attack of a persons cultural identity, trying to find their weakness to exploit it, selectively mentioning only parts of the bible first to get them to convert. Coming to us second hand, it's difficult to address this because you haven't actually said what they did. You've only vaguely described their practices through what appears to be a fairly biased lens. I suspect that you're misunderstanding what they said or that you generally object to people trying to influence another person's identity. But that's what persuasion is: an attempt to convince another person that what they currently believe is wrong and that they should believe something else. Trying to persuade an Afghan that he should let his wife go outside without a burqa is an attack on his cultural identity, but I think it's a good one. Persuasion is not force. It isn't possible to accurately convey the message of the Bible to someone who isn't familiar with it by lobbing it at them and saying ""read it"" or by reading it out loud to them in its entirety. You *have* to pick and choose what you're going to say and how you're going to explain it because the message is simple to say but actually very complex. If I've spent years learning about a nuanced belief, how am I supposed to convey accurate knowledge to you? Do you imagine that there's a different way than selecting specific passages integral to the Christian message and using them to give you Christianity 101? &gt;This emotional manipulation does not allow people to look at Christianity in an objective light and emphasizes acceptance of Christ rather than discovery of the truth (from a christian perspective). CMV? Casting Christian persuasion as ""emotional manipulation"" is unfair unless you apply that to all people trying to convince others and condemn them. (That makes this sub an epicenter of emotional manipulation.) From the Christian perspective, that acceptance is quite literally the discovery of truth. They are inseparable.

I can't even name any female-dominated hobbies off of the top of my head. This is total anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed that the default assumption on the internet where people are pseudonymous is that users of forums are male until stated otherwise. There are lots of women who might feel uncomfortable mentioning their gender online, since there are a lot of creepy guys who will bombard them with gross messages if they mention their gender. Also, men will often openly talk about fucking women or make sexual references, and women might just nope the fuck out when seeing that. These are all hypotheses of mine. I'm comfortable with mentioning my gender identity online, so I can't really say for certain how women who are uncomfortable with doing so might think, but the reasons above are some guesses.

Multiple intelligence agencies that have no dog in the hunt either way have confirmed this. So it was a dick move? Yep. Should we be talking about how this information was used to manipulate a population before an election? Absolutely. Is Russia dangerous to its neighbors and former Soviet Block countries? Certainly. Is Russia an imminent threat to what most Americans see as a desirable way of life to the point that they should be characterized as our supreme enemy and railed against at all costs? No. This hacking scandal is the tip of a much larger issue we, as Americans, have with Russia. They have a singular goal of destabilization when it comes to Western political power and alliance. They've had that goal since the 1940s. Since they could never do it with direct force, Russia has found ways to sew disruption by stoking and supporting elements of Western society and media that create dissonance. The fracture feeds the imbalance. The many different voices not listening to each other drown out any united ones.

"The argument: '1. I won't argue the assumption that people have the right to end their life, but that doesn't excuse the act of murder. If I wanted to end my life by being shot by an armed robber or being killed in a terrorist attack, does that suddenly make the armed robber or terrorist an upstanding citizen for honoring my request? No, because they're goddamn armed robbers and terrorists. 2. On your second point - assisted suicide comes with the prerequisite of getting the assurance from professionals that the patient wanting to die is of sound mind; in other words, a person who wants to die via this method CANNOT do it because they are depressed. All patients who use assisted suicide do it to avoid/remove physical pain and impairment since they are usually terminal, and, most importantly, are going to die anyway. Literally none of Meiwes' actions (or the person he killed' actions) meet this criteria. We can assume, like you said, this was an unexplored fetish from a mentally unsound mind. Assisted suicide does not take advantage of this fact and would have in fact denied someone for not being of sound mind. So already we have a clear agreement that what he did was not ""outstanding"" as he did this to serve his own needs at the disregard of a mentally unwell person. 3. Just because he asks for consent doesn't mean the act isn't deplorable. Is that really the only standard that makes him outstanding and everyone else a murderer? Just because I ask if I may rape someone or kill them or steal their money doesn't excuse the fact that the act itself is heinous. Why are you not judging his character based on the heinousness of the actual act? 4. Your 4th point has nothing to do with your argument that Meiwes is an outstanding citizen for doing what he did. You're saying that Meiwes is an outstanding citizen because, if we simply accept he is and remove his punishments, it will prevent future murders by fetishes? What??????

"The argument: 'While I don't necessarily think that a basic income system should be implemented, I think you may be missing a few of the proposed benefits. By my understanding, part of a basic income system would be the abolition or reduction of the minimum wage (and probably a reduction in wages across the board). This means a drastic reduction in labor costs, which would allow businesses to hire more workers and would make domestic workers more competitive. Simply stated, it would theoretically create the opportunity for many more people who are not employed to be employed. The basic income would also be relatively small; maybe enough to afford housing and basic foodstuffs. This would ensure that people aren't on the streets starving or incentivized to turn to crime or exploitation of the welfare system just to maintain a basic standard of living. People would also face a choice of either learning to live in the relatively uncomfortable conditions that the basic income allowed or working to make more money and improve their lives. That said, I've seen analogous systems on American Indian reservations with the distribution of casino revenue and federal assistance and it didn't look good. I'm undecided as to whether that was a function of the basic income disincentivizing labor or just an overall shitty situation that the basic income kept from turning into a complete horror show.'.

"The argument: 'I seriously doubt that more than a handful of men have been meaningfully chastised for their preferences. Those who have were probably in unique circumstances (around weird people) and most of those who think they have probably need to put idle comments or the ramblings of internet strangers in perspective. By and large, society never asks you what your preference is, nevermind shaming you for having it. Anecdote: I lift weights for fun and have been doing so for a few years. Many guys get into that hobby to attract women, but the truth is that for the most part, women don't care. If you've been lifting weights for longer than a a year you're motivated either by your own goals or by competition; women don't care if you lift another 50 lbs or add another inch to your bicep. If I keep lifting because I think they care, that's me being dumb, not anyone else's fault. So I do it for me and to silently compete with every other dude in the gym. That's how the gorilla chest-thumping stuff works: we might justify it by saying it's for women, but it's really about us. Conversely, my girlfriend has a lot of clothes. I don't understand any of them. She has complex outfit selections paired with shoes and jewelry and purses and makeup...don't understand it at all. She knows I don't understand it, but she still does it - either for her or to impress other women (where she gets the most knowledgeable compliments). To tie all this in, men aren't driving like morons because women want them to. They're driving like morons because they want to prove something to themselves or to other men. It has more to do with self-perception than anything else, and the people perpetuating the need for that particular self-perception seem to be male.'.

"The argument: 'Identities aren't unilaterally determined, they are negotiated. I may identify as a nice person, but if I don't do the things you think a nice person does, you're under no particular obligation to accept my claim. Doesn't matter how much that identity means to me, you don't have to share my belief if you don't think it's true. In relation to you, my claim to that identity would be meaningless and I would be expected to move on and get over it - and you would be expected to keep that to yourself unless the benefit derived from that confrontation over that disagreement was worth the pain you'd cause. The same goes for gender identity. If a trans person and I are informally negotiating a social interaction, part of what we negotiate is the degree to which I will entertain their claimed identity. If that person is a casual acquaintance, friend, or coworker, entertaining their identity costs me nothing. So long as I trust their honesty and their claims aren't outlandish (i.e. made up pronouns), I'll happily accommodate them and argue for others to do the same. That's the civil and kind thing to do, and it costs me nothing. A romantic relationship is a different matter. If I don't fully, honestly believe that a person's claimed gender is authentic or valid, then the operative question isn't whether I'm transphobic. It's whether or not I'm willing to engage in homosexuality to accommodate an identity claim *that I don't believe.* More than that, it's whether or not I'm willing to suppress that feeling indefinitely *regardless of what I believe.* I'm essentially being asked to lie to myself for someone else's benefit.

"The argument: 'Here's the thing: everybody is funny sometimes. Everybody is funny in certain ways. The question has never been whether she's funny, but whether the way in which she is funny is worthy of special attention. The argument is that, for some reason, a relatively mediocre comedian enjoys attention and status that isn't warranted by her talent. I tend to agree with that. From what I've seen, much of her comedy is not so much funny as it is transgressive. She says things women tend not to say - like talking about her period or sexual promiscuity. She makes raunchy sex jokes that are usually reserved for younger male comedians, and it is funnier because she's a woman and we don't expect that. So there are times and places where Amy Schumer is or has been very funny. But there's a wrinkle: I once heard it said that successful comedy requires the clash of two contending perspectives that makes us reevaluate or preconceptions. A joke is set up from one perspective, the punch line comes from another. The resulting absurdity and conflict are the things that shake us up and make us laugh. We can only really find things funny when we don't expect them. For many people, Amy Schumer's comedy no longer contains two perspectives. We know exactly what she's going to say - or at least, we're not very surprised by the second perspective she tries to introduce. Her comedy relied, in part, on us not expecting ""muh tampon"" or ""I'm such a slut"" to be that second perspective, but everyone's used to it now. We're not forced to abruptly reevaluate or reflect on anything because we're just waiting for her to say something that women don't tend to say. This tends to produce three groups: one that thinks she's funny, one that thinks she's boring/just doesn't care, and one that actively dislikes her. The latter group are an admixture of people who really don't want women to say things like that at all, and people who dislike deliberate crassness when they don't think it's accomplishing anything. I wouldn't dismiss any of these",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1.],7.0,True,False,News and Politics,"Universalism: concern,Universalism: objectivity"

You could just hold referendums and make decisions that way, but you elect officials so that you don't have to do that. You also elect them so that they can invest time in understanding the complexities and realities of an issue that most voters don't have time to mull over. So when you elect an official, you're not electing a conduit, but a thinking person empowered to exercise intelligence and judgment when making political decisions. If most people in his constituency are wrong about a certain issue (and would thus make the wrong decision in a referendum), his whole purpose is to use his own discretion and act against what they want and do the correct thing instead of the popular thing.

"The argument: '&gt; We continue to see this in the litigation that was brought against DNC regarding said sabotage, where the party's lawyers said -- in every sense of the word ""literally"" -- that the DNC is not democratic by nature, it has no imperative to provide open primaries, and that it is the prerogative of the committee to pick a candidate in a cigar lounge. Could you provide the quote where this was said? I can't find it when I search for those words. Also, Clinton won fairly, and by quite a lot. What do you think about the majority of democrats who just preferred her? &gt; The above alone would be, in my view, sufficient evidence for my position. However, it doesn't end there. In terms of the actual policy, Democrats do not have the backbone to support universal healthcare (60% -- nearly 2/3rds -- of Americans want single payer). Single payer is a much more controversial issue than you've presented here. People support it when you frame its positives, and they don't support it when you frame its negatives. Most people have no clue what it is... even people decently informed often have a very surface-level idea of how it works. Also, do you think Obama or Clinton wouldn't enact more progressive policies if they weren't hamstrung by congress? The ACA was explicitly a compromise (one the republicans rejected anyway). What about mainstream democrats tells you in any way that they wouldn't enact policies you like if they actually ever had the power to do so? &gt; n fact, we see this nearly 2/3rds number appear consistently in opinion polls on a variety of issues: wealth inequality, environmental protections, marijuana legalization, war prevention, and free public college, to name a few.

This is a sign you've been looking at some odd polls, because for such a disparate range of issues to have the same level of support is very unexpected and sketchy. Where's your source?

"The argument: '&gt;However, my disagreement lies within the methods used by those afflicted and supporters of them to rid themselves of these disorders. In my experience, through life's numerous ups and downs (also death), it has become obvious to me that these are inevitable, and will happen to everyone who chooses to continue living. Therefore, I believe it is fair to say that everything is what you make it. This mindset became obvious to me after the passing of my father when I was only seventeen. Your argument suffers from an ambiguity in the use of the term ""depression"". The type of depression you describe is a natural reaction to loss, and is one of the five stages of loss described by psychologists. Most (if not all) people experience this form of depression at some point in their lives. *Clinical* depression is not at all the same thing. It lasts much longer and typically has no rational explanation (e.g. a recent loss). It's a dysfunction of the brain, whereas short-term depression in response to loss is a product of normal brain function.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: '&gt; With gender identity I do not mean gender role as in one's behaviour as subjectictively placeable—or not—within the general social expectations of men and women respectively in the relevant culture; nor do I obviously mean biological charactaristics...... Essentially by definition is it not gender identity if it is observable through any other means than the subject telling you. But obviously gender identity is going to tend to be strongly correlated with societal gender expectations, right? All gender identity means is the personal level of comfort with one gender or another based on their own understanding of it (which will be made up of their own personal understandings of the general gender norms). You can separate them in theory, but not in practice.... you need gender first before you can identify with one. Furthermore, gender identity is going to predict important outcomes in terms of well-being, because it's upsetting to behave in ways that go against strong aspects of your identity. Also, gender identity is often what causes a mismatch between ""expectations"" and ""behavior"" to exist in the first place, which is going to have clear social consequences. '.

"The argument: '&gt; When people tell you ""Donald Trump has been endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan"", they want to associate images of the old Klan's crimes into your mind. But those images are entirely inconsistent with what you see in the MKKK. How on earth would you prefer that people report on this? The group that is called the KKK supported Trump. Do you want people to not use the name the group actually has? Do you want newspapers to include in parentheses that the KKK doesn't still murder people? I'm literally asking. The KKK endorsed Trump. I'm a newspaper reporter. It's newsworthy, because those people are racist. How on earth do you suggest I report on this? &gt; I don't know about you, but I judge people's actions more importantly than their words. You're misusing this cliche, and I think it's the main problem with your view. When ""actions speak louder than words,"" means something, it's typically to make the point that you can glean a person's ""true"" beliefs and attitudes from their actions better than you can from their words. Anyone can SAY they care about the poor, but the proof is in the pudding: Who actually VOLUNTEERS to work with the poor? THAT'S the best way to know who really cares. The phrase is not meant the way you seem to be using it: To somehow argue that terrorism is worse than racism, because the former is a ""behavior"" and the latter is ""words."" Not only is the distinction between behavior and words breaking down (speaking is a behavior, of course), but you're missing the point. The KKK couldn't be more up front about their beliefs, and there aren't all sorts of people falsely proclaiming their racism to the point that we need to look at behaviors to figure out who really means it. To put it another way, we don't just condemn people who dehumanize others because it leads to violence; often we condemn violent people because their behavior implies they dehumanize. The bad beliefs and traits are often the point. The KKK liking Trump means RACISTS like Trump; that's what people are upset about.'.

"The argument: '""Credibility"" is one of many factors to consider when making a narrative set in the past, and honestly, it doesn't strike me as a particularly important one. Much more important to me is the artistic statement or theme. Having a black Nazi can cause a modern observer to reflect on historical racial dynamics in a particular way that wouldn't be possible otherwise (I know nothing about CoD in particular, but this could be an element). For games, there's also the idea of immersion, which is distinct from suspension of disbelief. Having an avatar that resembles oneself increases a feeling of presence and engagement in a game, so giving black players that option would increase their enjoyment of the game. The other issue is that people's lay-theories about past social events can be wildly wrong. I don't know about black nazis, but there were black slave-owners in the American south. If you had a game with that element, people might decry it as unbelievable, even though it was true. People's blanket heuristics about ""what it was like in the past!"" shouldn't necessarily be trusted. Honestly, though, it doesn't really seem like you find the presence of black nazis distracting per se; rather, you find the perceived intentions of the game-makers to fulfill a quota distracting.

The joke is trading off the fact that male homosexuality is often seen as disgusting and homosexuals are often ridiculed as being weak or abhorrent. It's saying giving a man a blowjob is subservient and a bad thing worthy of derision. We shouldn't like Trump because he sucked a man's dick. That's not the main point being made.

And other than Joe, the rest of the band is barely there on at least half if not most of the album. That was never a problem with the band before.

"The argument: 'It depends on your broader moral perspective regarding abortion and/or sexism. Usually when someone says ""X is not morally wrong"", what they usually mean is that ""X is not *inherently* morally wrong"", That is, there is nothing necessary to the action of X-ing that makes it morally wrong. However, just because someone thinks X is not inherently morally unacceptable does not imply that they believe that *all specific instances* of X are morally acceptable. In particular, it may be that a specific instance of X would be wrong if performed for morally wrong reasons. For example, you might believe that hiring people for a job is not inherently morally wrong, but you might also believe that sexist actions are morally wrong. If so, then hiring people for a job because of their sex might also be morally wrong (depending on your broader views regarding what sexism is and when it's justified, if ever). The same logic should apply to abortions: you might believe that aborting a baby is not inherently morally wrong, but you might also believe that sexist actions are morally wrong. If so, then aborting a baby *because of their sex* might also be morally wrong (depending on your broader views regarding what sexism is and when it's justified, if ever). On the other side of the spectrum: you might believe that abortion is wrong because it constitutes killing a human being. In this case, it should be easier to see why the reasons behind the abortion might have moral implications. In ordinary situations, killing a human being is considered morally wrong. However, these killings may be justified depending on the *reasons* for the killing. For example, if a killing was done in self-defense, then the killing can reasonably be considered morally justified. However, if the killing was done because, say, the victim was of a certain sex, then the killing would remain morally wrong, because sexism is not considered a valid moral justification for killing a human.

You say that the ""Not All Muslims"" excuse isn't viable but it is; there are Christian terrorists in Africa who Western society mostly disregards as ""Not All Christians"". If Western Christians don't have to answer for those crimes of radical Christians, why do the Western Muslims? Religions aren't inherently radical or moderate, it's simply what the culture of the region makes of it. Arguing that the culture in the Middle East is popularly radical is a perfectly fine argument; there are many statistics to validate that opinion. But arguing that the doctrines are to blamed is definitely not reasonable, or else all Christians should be monitored the way Conservatives call for Muslims to be monitored because of what a different culture is doing in the East that goes by the same name as them. In fact, I'd argue that its &gt;more&lt; dishonest to simply say ""Islam"" as a whole and count every Muslim in for terrorism. I'm not saying that's what you're arguing for, but it's somewhere close. The Q'uran and Hadiths have been used as ""justification"" for radicals, but that does not mean that they inherently caused the radicalism. If they did, they would mean if you switched the Bible and the Q'uran throughout history since 0 AD, the ""West"" would be more Radical than the ""East"", and that isn't so. The radicalism is a matter of situation that resulted over many centuries of geographical and social history between various powers and the religions that they adhered to. eg the decline of the Ottoman's and the rise of Christians to be spread to the New World (now the West). The results of WWII and the Cold War also had a huge impact on the rise of modern Islam.

A parallel example is one from Socrates. I'm no expert just a casual fan of these things. But my understanding is there is a story that goes.

Socrates using the Socratic method (come up with a counter example making the proposition incorrect/absurd) asks the man, what about a brave fool? A man who was willing to sacrifice his life in an idea that would harm him and his loved ones, surely his bravery would work against him. For some additional thinking.

This is just a personal hypothesis, but I suspect that the desire for vengeance exists because we live in a deeply flawed world and the fulfillment of vengeance makes us feel safe. It reinforces the notion that the cost of hurting us is high. It may look like we share an inherent feeling of correctness when bad things happen to bad people, but if you look at in greater depth, it seems like that feeling has to be socially conditioned. This is evidenced by all the little psychological tricks we use to make make revenge appear more palatable in fiction, from putting villains behind masks to dehumanize them to making sure they scream defiance instead of begging for their lives in the end. When vengeance is shown in realistic gritty detail, it's intuitively less palatable to us. Or to take a recent example from the real world, in the Trayvon Martin case, you could tell which side people took by which imagine of him they used: the one that made him look like an innocent child or the one that made him look like a dangerous thug.

That's part of the point of being in *absolutely any* social club; you're doing it to be part of something that gives you the sort of reputation that you want, and to be a part of a group of people who share your interests. &gt;People also tend to favor the “more popular” fraternities and sororities because of the inherent attraction to top-tier reputation, making the less popular ones feel inferior. This ranking naturally creates hierarchy and social stratification. Hierarchy and social stratification happen naturally, though. This would happen because of either the perceived social value of the members of the fraternities, or outside of frats the earning power of a company or corporation. &gt;In spite of the benefits associated with Greek life, such as philanthropy and brotherhood, the initial process of getting into a Greek organization is demeaning and undermines human dignity by challenging perception of self-worth and by affecting people’s confidence and self-esteem.

There's hundreds of screenwriters who wrote some of the greatest movies you've seen, that you probably don't know by name. The shooter's ""work"" is still being talked about.

The notion behind ""Don't talk about the shooter"" isn't that we shouldn't remember these things, it's the hypothesis that more people will *specifically choose a mass shooting over other ways of killing themselves* because it will make them famous and get them validation, even if only posthumously. If we instead only focus on the tragedy, on the lives lost, then we take the focus away from the people who did horrible things and leave it on the actual tragedy.

Recently, during a **Game of Thrones** episode, Jaime raped his twin sister Cersei near the corpse of their son. Cersei pushed against him and repeatedly said ""No, don't do this. Not here. This isn't right."" Jaime said, ""I don't care."" This after he ripped her gown and called her a hateful woman. I have seen several discussions of this scene where men and women both have said ""she wasn't fighting hard enough for it to be *real* rape."" I have seen people try to explain it away by saying that, as his twin sister, Jaime doesn't see the need for his ""other half"" to give consent. Still others pointed out that because they'd had consensual sex in the past, it was understandable for Jaime to be confused. Earlier in the show, Jaime prevents his female squire from being raped, which some people seem to believe makes it impossible for him to be a rapist. Still others, including the director, have pointed out that the position of Cersei's legs implied consent. The director of the episode said that it was consensual because Cersei wanted something from Jamie and figured that this was the best way to get him to do it. When the camera cuts away, Cersei is still fighting and saying ""it's not right"", so I'm having a hard time seeing where consent happened, and I'm also not able to make the link between Cersei's motivations and this supposed consent. If this is what the director intended, he utterly failed. There has been a *lot* of confusion over whether this scene depicts rape. The fact that there is *any* confusion, and that the director of the show seemed to believe he was doing dubious consent leading to hot sex with dark motivations convinced me that many people, men and women, are confused about consent.

"The argument: 'The sorts of people who insist on using the term ""Romantic love"" are the sorts of people who have problems with the idea of polyamory because they have to codify everything into groups. I am very well aware of the problem of having to put everything into a neat container, after all I program computers; but that doesn't work as well for human emotions. If you're not familiar with the ""map and territory"" model of thinking, here's the basic rundown as I understand it: The territory of a known phenomenon is set, and our map of it is our best understanding; problems occur when the map isn't accurate to the territory. That said, part of my map of love is that it operates off of positive feedback loops; you love someone who loves you, and their love makes you happy so you love more. That's the basic pattern, until outside interference breaks the loop. Normally, it's life. Now, where most people get lost is that their map doesn't bother to take into account that there are more than 2 people in the grand system of life; kind of like the old joke where a physicist is trying to figure out why a cow is depressed and he starts with ""first we'll model the cow as a perfect sphere..."" it doesn't take into account crucial external variables that radically alter the output of the equation. The problem it runs into is that it assumes that love is zero-sum; that when you love someone else you automatically love the other person less. And that's just not true. Take children, for instance: when you have a child, you love them. When you have a second child, you love the second child as well. Do you love the first child less?

Yeah, so let's say courts find that showing someone's private sex tape only does them $50k worth of damage. Well, the lawyers are getting 1/3 of that off the top, plus expenses. So the plaintiff will maybe see $30k of it. Except it's too much work for lawyers to do on the premise that maybe they will earn $20k, maybe they will earn nothing, so Hogan either finds himself unable to sue or has to pay out of his own pocket. Suing then becomes a proposition of if you win you maybe break even and if you lose there goes your house. Meanwhile, let's say Gawker earned $200k in additional revenue by showing the tape. They're going to say, hey, we may have lost $50k in damages and $50k in legal fees, so this decision still earned us $100k in the positive. And that's the worst case scenario, most people won't even bother suing us for it. We should keep doing it.

An optic like a micro red dot on your weapon would more than make up for any difference. It's not about 25 yard accuracy; it's about muzzle climb per shot; no matter how great your sighting optics are, a.45 will have more muzzle climb than a 9mm of the same barrel length/same weight ahead of the trigger. You shoot *slower* because of it. Also, you rather understated ammo capacity. For the same size of pistol, a 1911 carries between 8 and 10 shots in the mag and 1 in the pipe. A Glock 17 carries 17+1. I chose the 1911 'cause it's the popular.45 model, but the Glock 21 (their.45 ACP model) is a 13+1 pistol. That's still 5 more shots. I'd much rather go into a firefight with double the shots before I have to reload; combined with the fact that I can put the shots on target faster means that I have a better shot at coming out ahead in that unfortunate situation. It also means that my ratio of ""time spent forcing rounds into a mag"" versus ""time spent throwing lead down-range"" when I'm at the range is more favorable in the direction of the latter. Another factor is cost: Any glock will cost about the same, so we'll consider that equal, even though most.45 guys I've met will want a 1911 and to get one that won't fuck up all the time, you need to spend twice the amount of money.

The purpose of a democracy is to vote for whoever you want, not to choose between two candidates. It's a broken system. It sounds like you're upvoting and downvoting in order to counteract a dissenting opinion. However, the purpose of the upvoting and downvoting system is to raise the insightful comments to the top and to bury the weak comments. These morphed into agree and disagree button, which doesn't serve the intended purpose. It's a broken system, and by using the upvote as an agree button, you're only contributing to the broken system. The correct course of action would be to re-haul the upvote/downvote system.

Instead, boys reported that talking about problems would make them feel “weird” and like they were “wasting time.” Men don't talk about their feelings because they feel it would be useless, not because they are afraid of social stigma. This is very much a feminist way to think about things. You identify a problem that women have- women like to hear about men's emotions, then avoid talking to men and asking them about it, and then you have a solution that says men should be more like women. Not that, in my experience, there has been any serious feminist effort to support emotional males. I've often seen them mock emotional males for complaining when they are part of the patriarchy. A kind attempt to help men asks the men what they need and tries to supply it, it doesn't ask women what they want and avoids supplying it because it's too much effort. Point 2 is a rather weak point as it is. It says ""If we do stuff for women, sometime in the future maybe men will be better off"". With rape, feminists have a really atrocious record on this. A lot don't recognize f on m rape as rape, feminists have tried to exclude f on m rape from academic studies, and feminists have very heavily stigmatized men as rapists, much more than in the past. I have, several times on reddit, heard something like ""rape can only be done from a position of power, men are part of the patriarchy, men can't be raped."" so this view is very consistent with feminist ideology.

William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis,"" according to a magazine editorial written by Church. &gt;Meanwhile, the NRA continued its commitment to training, education and marksmanship. During World War II, the association offered its ranges to the government, developed training materials, encouraged members to serve as plant and home guard members, and developed training materials for industrial security. NRA members even reloaded ammunition for those guarding war plants. Incidentally, the NRA's call to help arm Britain in 1940 resulted in the collection of more than 7,000 firearms for Britain's defense against potential invasion by Germany (Britain had virtually disarmed itself with a series of gun-control laws enacted between World War I and World War II). &gt;After the war, the NRA concentrated its efforts on another much-needed arena for education and training: the hunting community. In 1949, the NRA, in conjunction with the state of New York, established the first hunter education program. Hunter Education courses are now taught by state fish and game departments across the country and Canada and have helped make hunting one of the safest sports in existence. Due to increasing interest in hunting, NRA launched a new magazine in 1973, The American Hunter, dedicated solely to hunting issues year-round. NRA continues its leadership role in hunting today with the Youth Hunter Education Challenge (YHEC), a program that allows youngsters to build on the skills they learned in basic hunter education courses. YHECs are now held in 43 states and three Canadian provinces, involving an estimated 40,000 young hunters. Their goal is to increase marksmanship with a primary purpose being strengthening the government militaries, a secondary purpose being strengthening hunters. They don't have a purpose of stopping the military from conquering the land. '.

If one could identify these triggers, assess one's reactionary behaviors, and replace one behavior with another (which I believe that people unquestionably *can* do so), then it's very possible for someone who has cheated before to not do this activity again. The questions then become, will they spend the time doing that analysis and can they replace one reaction with another easily, which is still emotionally restorative? '.

It would be silly to only consider renewable energy generation. While I think it is super important to support nuclear, hydro, large-scale solar, and wind it is also important to utilize the electric grid whenever possible. Not only is it more efficient to produce power centrally and on a large scale but there are more efficient fuels than gasoline that can be used when you aren't worried about carrying around the fuel in a moving vehicle. You also have to realize that gasoline cars use absolutely no renewable energy whereas electric cars can utilize the renewable energy from the grid. Where I live this is close to 100% (hydro, wind) but on average it is around 15%. Plus energy is only getting more renewable.

"The argument: 'You're conflating two different phenomena: saying ""It's the principle of the thing"" and making decisions based on principles. The former isn't an explanation of why something should or shouldn't be done, it's at best only saying that there is some kind of principle, without even specifying what it is. More often, it's just an emotional response. I agree that saying ""It's the principle of the thing"" is bad. But reasoning based on principles is not the same as that. You imply that decisions should be ""based on principles and not the merits of issues"", but how do you determine what the ""merits of issues"" are without principles? Principles vs evidence is a false dichotomy - principles are applied to evidence. If the evidence tells you that X causes Y, principles (loosely speaking) will tell you if Y is good, bad, or irrelevant. You use ""we do not negotiate with terrorists"" as an example of something that's done ""based on principle"", but that doesn't mean that evidence didn't go into deciding to follow it. I don't know what the empirical evidence on this issue is, but it's possible that because negotiating with terrorists gives them what they want, it has a worse outcome than not negotiating with them, in the long run. Sure, if they've kidnapped someone, you could ransom them, but that tells the terrorists that their methods work, and maybe they're going to kidnap someone tomorrow again, and next month, and the month after that... Whereas if you firmly commit to a policy of non-negotiation, and show them that you're committed to it by not negotiating with them, they'd have no incentive to kidnap in the future. Thus, the principle of ""we do not negotiate with terrorists"" doesn't appear out of thin air, but is based on other reasoning.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'Cheating, or sex of any sort, carries several quite heavy risks- pregnancy, stds, angry partners. This risk is increased if you are a high value partner- a lot of contraception is deliberately used poorly with the hope of impregnation. If you value your partner highly and don't want to lose them then this high risk set of activities should rationally be avoided. You can get your extra fun from porn. Many people also have strong values which say it is wrong to hurt your partner and cheat on them, and the emotional pain of cheating will make them want to avoid it. It is rational to avoid pain.

Stuff like, “On Women’s Rights: Yeah, Yeah. Blah, Blah. Whatever.” And “A Rant.” And “Five Ways Feminism Helps Men.” And a site dominated by female voices.

"The argument: 'This comes from mistakenly viewing communism or socialism as something based on sharing, or that people had some great inability to follow rules which made communism fail. Communism and Marxism was never really about sharing or caring or freedom or creativity.

Communists like himself ""have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole."" and are inherently good willed and helpful unlike. He then wanted monopoly control over communication, the banks, he wanted to abolish marriage and enact child labour, lots of stuff. And communist countries did function. True, people got pretty drunk on the job, true, the labour was pretty shoddy, but communists countries did get a lot done. https://i.imgur.com/MdUbfEf.png When they industrialized and advanced their science their life expectancy went up, their GPD went up. Communism is a fairly normal technological authoritatian style dictatorship. Science makes it fairly easy to care for people and people do respond reasonably well to being told what to do. It had trade schools to train people for jobs and they did those jobs well enough to please their superiors or they got punished. Communism worked reasonably as expected. The communists got in power, they carried out their various whims with social policy, and the population was forced to work by schooling systems and the police. Due to their military urges Russia overreached somewhat, and lost a lot of money competing with the far more advanced America and trying to hold together their ethnically diverse empire, but that wasn't really much to do with selfishness.

"The argument: 'I think it's important to make a strong distinction between why people chose to engage in polyamory. Some people chose to do it because they like having sex with lots of people. Someone who might be a cheater in another relationship might pressure their partner to engage in it, perhaps with the aid of drugs. Both people would have intense jealousy when the other cheats and the relationship won't work well. Some do it because it's a part of their culture and they feel it's expected. Think people like hippies, religious people who feel it's obliged, things like that. They may have more discipline, but they still often find it is unsuited to them. These two groups are likely the ones who you mean. They are utterly unsuited to the lifestyle and so they face immense issues when they try it, and their relationship breaks apart. Many describe being polyamorous as something like a sexuality. Imagine someone straight trying to force themselves to be homosexual (political lesbians, prison gay) and imagine how that would go. Some people do it because they don't feel jealousy but they enjoy the feeling of fresh love and passion. They have enough discipline to avoid doing things that break up their relationship.

There was a guy two rows in front of me who was literally holding his head in his hands, and the person with him was rubbing his back.

Another theme was about not liking either candidate—you know, “I wouldn’t vote for either one.” Someone said that Jonathan Gordon [the male Hillary Clinton] was “really punchable” because of all the smiling.

Rural areas in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas are served by part-time ID offices.

"The argument: 'I will try to address your viewpoint in three parts, namely history, temperament, and mis-identification. On the assertion that &gt;My view is that pitbulls were bred as fighting dogs and to be as mean and agressive as possible Indeed, pitbulls were bred from terriers and bulldogs originally in the 1800s in the hopes of emulating the gameness and agility of the terrier with the strength of the bulldog, as illustrated by [this wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull#History), which further leads to [this (now dead link) from the UKC, the second oldest kennel club in the United States](http://www.ukcdogs.com/Web.nsf/Breeds/AmericanPitBullTerrier). There is no denying that Pitbull as a breed is purposefully bred for traits ideal for blood-sports such as bull-baiting and bear-baiting. At the turn of the century however, as blood-sports are gradually outlawed, pitbulls began to be bred as a catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and drive livestock, and as family companions. So while the purpose of their breed is as you claimed in the beginning, it has now become largely obsolete. Pitbulls are now bred for underground fights you may argue, but that's due to their bad reputation as being ferocious, with little understanding of their actual temperament. This leads me into my second point of temperament. Right off the bat, I would like to put forth this [study in 2014](http://www.avmamedia.org/display.asp?sid=526&amp;NAME=National_Dog_Bite_Prevention_Week_2013_%28May_19-25%29) where it found that breed is a terrible and unreliable predictor of temperament.

You can be close to someone based on nothing but their appearance or voice or smell. Honesty isn't required. 2. People have lots of hurtful feelings about people's sexuality, race, gender, religion, politics, appearance. Things that aren't really easy to change or fix. Having people repeatedly tell you that they hate looking at your face and your boss that you're ugly so they're not going to approve a pay rise you'd need for plastic surgery isn't really going to help you fix yourself. 3.

It’s essential that its strategies and settings be chosen with care, and adjusted properly as the collision rate changes or new information becomes available. As the ultimate and irreversible filter, it’s also a potential cause of disappointment or even disaster, so opinions about it are strong and emotions run high. There is far more data than there is storage software for data. As such, most is dumped. That means it's necessary for theorists to predict where interesting information will likely be found. Something like string theory is similar. They have a number of predictions- http://phys.org/news/2014-01-scientists-theory.html Which can be tested to see if the physical world behaves in an unusual way.'.

The way to fix this of course is to select for people who believe strongly in science and don't believe in magic.

If you know the sorts of reviews a company offers and what sort of media they enjoy then you can gain useful information. If they rarely offer 10s then you know this is a really high quality thing by their standards. If they often offer them you know it's pretty decent.

For the Shawshank redemption only 4% thought it was average (7), and 50% thought it was really good (10) For toy story 14% thought it was average and only 25% thought it was really good. 8 vs 9 gives me a very good sense of how good the film is. 9 says ""You absolutely need to see this"" while 8 says ""You'll probably enjoy it, but there's a better than average chance you won't view it as great.""

"The argument: '&gt;However, I believe it is meaningless to other people since each person's perception of what it means to be a woman/man is different. Hence I believe it is essentially meaningless when told to other individuals. I could be wrong about this, you may correct me (I am not saying I am 100% right. No disrespect meant), but I believe that when non-binary individuals identify as such it is because they feel they do not entirely fit into the perception of being male or being female. However, in my personal opinion, I think that does not mean they aren't a woman or a man, but they're just a person who does not really fit into the society's views of what a man or a woman should be. I think it is upsetting that people feel that they are restricted in a box by society due to their gender. The brain has an innate sense of it's shape, including what sort of genitals it has.

If I were cis and I came out saying, ""Oh my God, no! I'm not transgender! No, no, no!"" that's just reinforcing this stigma about being transgender that costs so many lives. &gt;Ultimately, being transgender is a private, very serious medical issue that needs to be addressed as early in life as possible. I don't think it's helpful to anyone involved to treat it like a litmus test, where a person must come out publicly. &gt;Thirdly, for anyone that's publicly transgender - I've had friends that are out tell me about the pain it causes in it coloring everything that they do. I have a friend that's a well known software engineer. She's has people writing her all the time about how inspiring she is. She appreciates the sentiment, but she says it brings her back to the most painful period of her life. In becomes an adjective in front of that person's name - coloring everything they do when the goal was to just feel like their true self. So there's nothing bad about trans people, she doesn't want to encourage public disclosure because people might be forced to do it. The mistake in reasoning you make is extended her idea that there's nothing bad about being trans to the idea that there's nothing good. &gt;But she shouldn't triumph Samus Aran as a trans character if ""it doesn't matter"". There's nothing wrong with Samus Aran being trans, but Brianna may well feel there's something good. As such, since there's no privacy issues due to Samus being fictional, she can do it.

"The argument: '&gt;The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong. Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do ""bad things"", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense. I view the endless evolution of religious perspectives over the course of human existence to to be something of an ongoing debate about morality. Certainly some people get stuck in religious dogma, but rather I think that our evolving sense of morality is the driving force behind new religions, new sects, new interpretations, etc. We have always been constantly thinking and arguing about what is right and what is wrong. The variety of religious teachings reflect this debate, rather then the other way around. &gt;The need for an afterlife in most religions satisfies our general fears of death, and the impermanence and futility of our lives. The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. Your entire argument hinges on the idea that no afterlife can possibly exist, because it hasn't been rigorously proven to exist by science, and so having the idea that it exists is weak. By that token it was once weak to believe that humans might be able to fly, and it was weak to think that the earth revolved around the sun. By that view it is currently weak to believe that there might be life elsewhere in the universe, because it hasn't been proven to be true yet. There might actually be an afterlife. There might not be. As of now, there really isn't any way to know, because we haven't invented a way of observing that yet.

The Koreans believe that fans kill people. These beliefs are stupid and should be challenged. Those people who believe in those things shouldn't be stigmatized as mentally ill, they should be corrected and experts who they trust (ideologically aligned ones) should be informed of the correct facts. By imposing your atheism on public policy you are actually making it more likely that those people who believe stupid things will continue believing. I mean, what sounds more convincing to you?

A caning is swift and then over - prison is years of torture. A caning only punishes the offender; imprisonment collectively punishes his wife, children, employer, and friends. It tears up marriages, deprives children of their parents, ends working relationships, and makes the offender unable to find most jobs afterwards. It is far more likely to accidentally turn into a death sentence than a beating is. We need to deter certain crimes that do not need extensive rehabilitation and which cannot be properly deterred by monetary fines.

If I started a new company specializing in longer-lasting batteries, am I likely to just ""leech off Energizer"" and end up hurting my cause? I don't think so. I think the new company will find ways to lengthen the life of batteries. I think Energizer and Duracell will find ways to lengthen the lives of their batteries in order to compete. At minimum the extra money I've spent on this venture is helping that research. The same is true with charities. If I donate $100k to a foundation to look at sickle cell anemia, that's $100k going towards sickle cell research. It also creates more competition and choices amongst the charities serving that need.

"The argument: 'If you don't pay a source, you know for sure that source has an agenda. Otherwise, why would they waste their time talking to a reporter? The agenda may be as benign as fame-seeking, but more likely it is because the source has a specific bias on the issue that makes their information one-sided. Indeed, much reporting is simply passing on press releases. The fact that reporters don't pay their sources leads to the [75/20/5](https://medium.com/tech-blogging/43d78a82e103) rule: that 75% of what you read is vaguely right; 20% is entirely untrue; only 5% is actually completely correct.

"The argument: 'I think the issue I have with your argument is that ""men can't act like women"" actually is to a large extent a simple subset of ""men can't be weak"". Men are permitted to wear their hair long. They are allowed to arrange flowers. They are allowed to carry water. They are allowed to cook. They are encouraged to take good care of children provided they also have a job. They are allowed to clean. These are all ""feminine"" things that men are encouraged to do if they happen to be good at it. Men are not allowed to be weak. They are not allowed to wear stupid clothing, and it so happens that most stupid clothing is female or disappears from existence because who else would buy it. They are not allowed to be unemployed, even if they have kids. They are not allowed to be ignorant of how to fix the important/basic things in their lives. To a large extent, it's just that the only people who are allowed to celebrate weakness/failure are women, and so you call those domans of weakness feminine. But the domains of strength that might be called feminine (good with kids, clean, cooking, design, etc) are totally allowed for men just as any domain of strength is.

That's engagement. That's what public debate entails. If you want your students to learn how to give excellent pro-life arguments, they'll need to learn how to engage with ridicule or angry retorts. They won't be well-served erasing all that. &gt;Now on the other hand, how far do we go with allowing campaign groups.

I'm a pretty fast ready, so my usual MO when watching subtitled is to read the line quickly, then observe the visuals. I'm guessing that about 1/4-1/3 of the time, I'm looking at the words and thinking about them, instead of observing the scene. An average reader may be more like 1/2 of the time, giving them less time to actually look at the scene. I'd posit that for a movie with quality dubbing (which you acknowledge does exist), if the strength of the movie is in the visuals then the dubs might beat subs. As an aside, I heard this interesting interview with the guy who is the voice of Tom Cruise in Germany (I think, details are hazy) - that is, he's the guy who dubs Tom Cruise's voice when the movies are dubbed in German.

There are few perverse incentives when it comes to race - you can't change or fake it very easily.

"The argument: 'It is already illegal. None of the examples you gave are deception. Two of your examples are products claiming to be ""healthy"". Nutritionists hardly agree about what products are ""healthy"". Is chocolate healthy? Is Trix? Nobody knows. If they made specific claims like ""Nutella improves renal function in Type-2 diabetics"" then we could prove/disprove them. But as long as a food meets FDA requirements regarding lead/mercury/PCBs/bacteria/etc, you can say it's healthy. The insurance commercial certainly isn't complete. There's fine print and you know it. But it's not misleading. I've never seen insurance claim to be auto insurance but not qualify legally as auto insurance. That's illegal. If something is advertised as life insurance, it's life insurance. The exact rules might be too complex for a 30-second spot, but it's not going to turn out to be a warranty on a microwave. Deception is already illegal, and there is no trickery going on in any of your examples. Some advertisers do lie, and you're sure to be able to find some if you look hard enough.

Would you want your child to be spoiled and immoral, naive to how the world works, living on your work?

I (and Gates and Buffett) don't want our kids spoiled and unchallenged. But we do want what is *best* for our kids. We want our kids to have the very healthiest food, optimum medical care, and optimum dentistry. To be given a superb work ethic and to learn great values. So far, that could plausibly be given to every kid in an ideal world but would be too expensive to give to every kid in our current world. We also want our kids to be taught by the very best teachers and to have every opportunity for personal growth/learning. That literally can't be given to every kid - there will always be some teachers who are better than others, and some opportunities that are limited. So no - we don't want an even playing field for our kids, and we don't want our kids doomed to a life of idle aristocracy.

Loss of technical knowhow - we have a very well educated populace. Even if we had a massive war, we would not expect to lose enough people to truly deprive us of the knowhow. Maybe a nuclear exchange, sure. Educational reforms are unlikely to weaken us given our very diverse educational system - if one kind of school is driven to failure, we have other competitor schools. Crippling debt? Maybe but we aren't there yet, and usually that alone isn't enough. Social unrest?

"The argument: 'Doctors and scientists are the most well educated and most skeptical people on the planet. They didn't trust the idea at first, and spent years experimenting and debating the merits of vaccines. But that was over 200 years ago. The first vaccine was discovered in 1798. Since then, literally billions of vaccines have been given without incident. Even the most skeptical, but intelligent person can find ample evidence that they are safe and incredibly valuable. The only people who doubt vaccines today are incredibly uneducated and ignorant people. I don't mean that as an insult. They simply don't have the scientific understanding to determine if a vaccine is safe on their own. That means they have to rely on someone else to translate for them. At that point, it isn't a matter of understanding, it's a matter of trust. What color is the sky? You can go outside and see that it is blue. But, lets say you are blind. You've never seen the sky, and barely understand the concept of color at all. The only way you can find out is if you ask someone else. If you dad says that the sky is blue, and your friend says the sky is neon green, who is telling the truth? You trust your dad, but what if he says the sky changes color? One day he says it's light blue, then later that evening he says it looks reddish-orange, then that night he says it's black. What if he once screwed with you when you were a kid as a joke. Do you still trust him? Scientists don't have to rely on trust. If they are skeptical, they can just design an experiment for themselves. In fact, there is a big incentive to do so because if a scientist can disprove a major theory, there is fame and fortune, and Nobel Prizes to be had. But most of them have looked at the idea critically, and decided there isn't any evidence. Modern anti-vaccine activists simply don't have the understanding to do the same.

"The argument: 'There is two clear differences between Uber/Lyft and other taxi deregulation experiences: the ability to price compare prior to entering a taxi and the ability to drive a taxi opportunistically. In the Wikipedia's listed examples, riders are unable to find fare information prior to entering a taxi. One can ask a driver, reject his offer, and wait for a new taxi... but that costs the rider a lot of time. In the Lyft/Uber model, one can discover a taxi's price far more easily. So this will drive down fares rather than increasing them. In the traditional model (with or without deregulation), if I drive a taxi that's what I'm doing with my time. I look around for fares and drive them around, and then when I'm done I can do what I want with my life. If I spend 2 hours ferrying passengers, that's 2 hours gone from my day. In the Lyft/Uber model, if I'm driving home from work I can pick up fares essentially along the way. I might well spend 45 minutes ferrying passengers while adding only 15 minutes to my travel time. This kind of opportunistic taxi is energy-efficient since much of the gasoline would have been spent anyway by the driver on her already-planned travel. So if Lyft/Uber become more widespread, it's true we're putting a bunch of taxi drivers out of business. But we're letting people get rides more cheaply, we're spending less of our fossil fuels, and we're letting people with long commutes get some extra compensation by taking on passengers. '.

"The argument: 'Theoretically you are right, but practically you have it reversed: psychology is much less likely to be valid cross-culturally than psychiatry is. Most psychology studies are done specifically on WEIRD subjects (Western, Educated, from Industrialized, Rich, Democratic countries). The findings frequently do not generalize to all cultures. When we study fairness, reasoning style, etc, there is little reason to believe that the results are the same in Haiti as they are in Harvard. Psychiatry, on the other hand, focuses primarily on things that are really broken - things that break in much the same ways regardless of culture. Schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, addiction, etc etc. Now of course to some extent rich countries have a culture that says ""yes, it's worth lots of money to treat depression"" where poor countries cannot afford such treatment. But the thing is, they would if they could. We see it - as they become richer, they adopt the same value on treatment. Sure, you describe the possibility that a particular schizophrenic person might be seen as a holy man - and this occasionally occurs - but usually not. And psychiatrists already learn to take cultural differences in presentation into account. They do not say ""I saw an angel"" is a clear delusion if the person being evaluated is part of a religion/culture that sees angels all the time. So psychiatry really isn't about enforcing the values of leadership onto other people (with the exceptions of preventing suicide and attacks on others - and sure I can see that's culturally based, but most of psychiatry isn't about those). It's really about people choosing treatment for conditions that exist in every culture, are recognized by every culture that learns of them (there aren't cultures that say ""I understand you call this schizophrenia, but I promise you it's something holy instead"", though there are specific rare individuals about whom they might say ""I understand that if you didn't know what I know you'd assume this was schizophrenia but I promise you it's something holy instead""), and are valued basically universally.

If I understand correctly, you are saying that a person may be a reincarnation of a specific other (now deceased) individual and then would share some identifiable traits. If this is true, we would expect a good reincarnation expert (monk? priest?) to be able to make specific predictions about your behavior more accurately than a good Western psychiatrist or car salesman could. So now we have a testable hypothesis. I'd certainly be curious to see the results of the experiment, but I have a strong prima facie expectation that the reincarnationalist will not be great at this.

If you and your boyfriend decide to stop dating, and to truly commit to one another, marriage happens. You become different people than you were before, and your relationship becomes different. There is a real change and that is what we call marriage. Do you really want to reject that kind of bond just because historically it was priests performing the ceremony? That the specifics of the ceremony don't matter can be easily seen from the experiences of immigrants or minorities. A Jew in a Moslem country may not have registered his marriage with the government, may not receive any tax benefits, may not even be explicitly legally defined as married. Yet it is apparent to all his neighbors, to Imams, etc that the marriage is real. Likewise if a married couple in the UK reveal that their marriage was performed in Sealand by the Prince Regent, their marriage is no less real for having been performed in a nation not recognized by the UK. So by all means come up with new wedding customs or work change the legal benefit structure. But to reject marriage itself is far more difficult.

Alcohol (and drugs in general) also affects people differently, so it's not like everyone will have the huge urge to drink, just as different people may or may not have different addictions. Remember that alcoholism is not just based on environmental factors; twin studies and artificial selection studies have strongly indicated that genetics play a large factor, so someone may need a lot more ""willpower"" or better environmental factors than you do to prevent or overcome alcoholism. Now of course there may be some people who aren't actually an alcoholic and just use it as an excuse to drink. But this is not always the case. Alcoholism is a progressive disease that just gets worse as time goes by without proper management. Alcohol is a drug, so it literally impairs the brain and will make it harder to make good judgment calls. Genetic and environmental predispositions will also make the addiction harder to control. People can become physically dependent on the drug as well. You mentioned that people just ""blame their brain chemistry"" and do not feel responsible for their actions... well, just because you're responsible for a disease doesn't mean it's not a disease. If I drink a gallon of soda every day and end up getting diabetes, it will mostly be my fault, but it doesn't mean that my consequent diabetes isn't a disease. And brain chemistry is a legitimate reason alcoholism is a disease --think about depression. People in depression can't just ""snap out of it"" since their brain is literally different from normal people's. Similarly, alcoholics can't necessarily just ""snap out of it.""

Obviously there are semi-rules such as drug use, speeding, or frisbee throwing that are broken regularly, but I do not believe there are any that genuinely break societies ""fundamentals"" that people break without consequences that exceed the potential benefit. In particular your horrific example is punished in a way that far exceeds whatever you might hope to get out of it. '. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

You can't hide an objective fact though. People are mislead by the term national debt (and more specifically by the politicians who describe it in misleading ways), but once they learn what it actually means, there is no going back. The problem with rebranding it is that you can rebrand it as something scarier than what it is too. Plus the risk with rebranding is that you might make it seem too safe.

"The argument: 'The thing about a 'baby face' is that, when you get into your general middle age - you enter a wierd neutral zone where your age becomes totally indeterminate and you get the benefits of looking older and younger at the same time. I'm 31 and people's assumption of my age comes down entirely to my clothes and the setting I'm in. I can go to a concert or a festival in jeans and a t-shirt and fit in with everyone around me, or I can put on a suit, put some product in my hair, and look like a proper adult. The *ideal* of youth is and has always been highly valued across all cultures and civilizations, but cultural markers such as dress and bearing are always going to be preferred over physical appearance. If you dress like a grown-up and conduct yourself like a grown-up - people will assume you're a grown-up. Likewise if you want to dress down and have some fun - people will assume that you're of an age and status to behave like a young person. As a 19-year-old, I guarantee that, if you went out and bought some nice slacks, some tailored shirts, got a good haircut, and watched your posture - people would start assuming you were 22-25. By the time you're 30, you'll have the option of throwing on some jeans and a band tee and going to a concert or throwing on a tie and going toe-to-toe in a boardroom. Us younger-looking guys have an advantage outside just looking younger as we age. We can choose: based on our clothes and our grooming: which group to fit into. It's a lot easier for a young guy to look older and more mature by dressing up than it is for an old guy to look younger by dressing down. Think of a time when you've seen a 40+ dude in a Tapout shirt and skinny jeans if you don't believe me.

We don't know what percent of stayers hate the parking lot since that's a group much less likely to hate anything about the company than leavers. But it's a high enough number to be concerning, and therefore well worth a new poll. You don't have any proof, you have an interesting correlation well worth further investigation.'.

You're probably jumping to conclusions and he may be a nice guy, but there is a pile of people to choose from, why take a risk? So hiring is all about the right fit and balancing risk. People who cannot portray themselves online in whatever we deem is professional online, get labeled as risky. Whether it should or should not happen isn't the question, it is happening. So those riskier people end up not getting job offers as often. You can scream about how it's unfair, but you can also understand why it happens, and understand there are costs associated with hiring people that cannot be recouped.

The reasons you listed, are at best theoretical, with the exception of minimizing the suffering of animals, which is even more subjective since not everything we eat can feel pain and suffer to begin with (Shrimp, Lobster etc.) For starters, even if we were to uselessly butcher all of our domesticated meat animals down to a reasonable level, there's no telling how their behavior in the wild would influence every other habitat at this point. It's also very possible that they would become an invasive species throwing other biomes into disarray through their untethered consumption of flora and fauna for any instance where they are effectively apex predators. Then there's also the aspect of introducing new large animals into a domestic society. Imagine living out in the country and having to worry about wild cattle getting upset with and killing you, in a chance encounter. This has the potential to cascade into the housing market and effect the economy in ways unrelated to the job market. There's also the issue of filth to consider. Right now we have all these dirty domestic animals contained in a select few locations. We also treat them for disease. if left to run wild they could have unprecedented effects on things like cockroach populations, or mosquito outbreaks both of which are our problem.

I don't think the comparatively small number of actual trolls justifies this idea.

"The argument: '&gt; I see lots of people when calling for an end to the electoral college they use this ""The people should have the final say on the matter"" kind of argument, but I believe that this is an argumentum ad populum fallacy.

"The argument: 'Everything in science is controversial. Controversy is essential and beneficial for science, which lives on the assumption that we don't know something and want to explain it. Our explanations are rarely perfect and are, at times, completely off base. Where this ""fails"" is when undereducated people hear ""science made a mistake!"" and think this is a valid refutation of the results of unrelated science, as if science were a social issue. Assuming good methodology, scientific conclusions are not disproven by people getting a large group together and shouting ""That is wrong!"" Scientific conclusions are disproven by further refinement and repetition of experiments. So in a sense you are right. The most loudly advertised controversies in science aren't really as controversial as is claimed. Science is still controversial. We are *really* certain that global warming is a consequence of human action, enough that very few self-respecting scientists deny that humanity needs to change its global impact. However, we don't know for sure that is the case and it is still possible (though very unlikely) some damning evidence may prove the idea wrong. More likely, further evidence will prove that we don't know the whole picture and we'll get a better idea of what we are doing that is causing problems, what the full extent of those problems are, and how to start changing them.

"The argument: '**Borders/Immigration** - It depends on what you believe American values are. Some people believe that their moral or ethical values are what make up the thing we call ""American values"". In this case, different people will have different definitions of what this term means. Others would argue the Constitution and Declaration of Independence are the root of American values. While people can argue over the interpretation, at least this provides a distinct list of things we can attribute as American values. Stuff like due process, freedom of press, freedom of religion, etc. What I mean is that our values are encoded in the very mechanisms for governing. Those who believe American Values are a set of moral and ethical things that define our society I would assume are much more concerned about the potential impacts of immigration. Because these values aren't codified in law and are more defined by public sentiment, they seem more at risk. For those who feel the values are rooted in the Constitution in particular, they are probably less concerned since the Constitution is a set of rules by which the nation defines it's values and provides means to change them over time as times change. Embracing the Constitution means accepting that times change and Amendments can happen. The very thing that defines the nation, America, is made to be changed if the nation needs them to. We have a history of embracing immigrants from all over the globe who often don't bring with them common values to the people already in America. The story of German immigrants in the midwest was one of being shunned for their values, considered alcoholics, etc yet today no one is concerned about the negative impact they had on our society.

Otherwise what's the point on going to a typical Italian restaurant for an authentic Italian experience, if the chef is Indian and the waiter Pakistani?

The German stereotype for example is only really applicable to Bavaria, and even then many people won't identify with Lederhosen and Dirdnl. There are many nuances to each region which most people from their own country may not even be aware of.

I didn't get the full Swedish experience."" You have to realize that, by that point, the melting pot *will actually be* the full Swedish experience.

Other than your own personal feelings and hopes of how the countries ""should be"", there isn't really any point in fighting to prevent culture from being reshaped through the ages (at it has been done since the dawn of humanity). Another way to put this is: would a Swede complain about not having the full American experience because he visited New York and it wasn't only populated by ""Americans"" doing ""american things""?

We don't leave our personal belongings unattended in public in case they get stolen. I think, and please do correct me if I'm wrong, that you are applying the same logic to an intoxicated, unaware person being raped as someone carelessly leaving their iPhone 6 on the table while they pay a visit to the bathroom. Now, I know you want to focus purely on cases where rape victims were intoxicated, but we *have* to look at the psychology and motive behind rape, which will take in cases of all kinds. Rape is often not opportunistic in the same way as taking an unattended phone might be. It is not ""unfortunate"" in the same way someone walking in a crime ridden area late at night and getting mugged is. A person being careless with their possessions or wandering into an unsafe area still had more of a chance of avoiding their situation by thinking ahead than a rape victim. Rape is often *not* someone simply feeling horny and wanting sex. That type of scenario would be easier to avoid in some ways because you could, for argument's sake, avoid frequenting somewhere where you know people are highly sexually charged. Rape is more often than not about physical control or a warped sense of entitlement to sex with the unwilling participant. Because of this fact, and the undercurrent of prevalence of your exact view, intoxicated victims may not report what happened to them because they feel they ""brought it on themselves"" and will be doubted anyway. But rape is not a predictable, easily dodged crime. Rape is 100% to do with the assailant's decision to rape. If anything, being vulnerable in any way leaves you in a potentially sticky scenario, including being a child, being of slight stature, wearing a skirt, it being night time... the list is fairly endless depending on the context.

Ephebophilia describe the PREFERENCE for mid-to-late adolescent sexual partners and is not a paraphilia. Indeed attraction (and preference) to sexually mature adolescents is normal and expected on an evolutionary level. However with the enormous increase in lifespan due to the development of technology the age gap (as well as the knowledge and skill gap) in a hypotetical adult/teen relationship can be so big that I wonder whether this perceived cultural bias can do good to prevent many relationships that will end up being abusive and manipulative with respect to the (often too much) younger partner.'.

"The argument: 'A word count gives you an idea of how complex to make your writing. You don't want to right a 20 page paper for something that was expected to be 1500 words, and the nature of written assignments often means that the depth required is vague otherwise. Any sort of word count generally helps achieve this goal. When you're assigned a paper with a hard minimum like you're describing, they are telling you the absolute minimum that they believe is sufficient. This number is in general not what you should be shooting for, and I think it's fair to assume that even if you didn't lose points directly for failing to reach the limit, you would lose a great deal for your essay lacking the depth expected. Imagine you had an assignment to answer 10 questions (of any type, that's not important). The implication here is that you must, at a minimum, answer all 10 questions to have completed the assignment, and it would be reasonable to expect significant deductions if you failed to do so. What you should probably actually do is answer all 10 questions correctly and thoroughly, but the minimum standard tells you when you've just barely completed the assignment. Handing in a 2400 word essay is like only answering some of the questions. You haven't completed the assignment to the expectation. TL;DR: The minimum is not what you should be shooting for, you should be well above it, in most cases. Writing less than the minimum probably would lose you just as many, if not more, points for content if the length was ungraded.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: '&gt;The pledge of allegiance has been around for awhile and has served its purpose well. It really hasn't been around all that long. It only became adopted by Congress in 1942. As for it's purpose, what can you attribute to the Pledge of Allegiance that could not be attributed to something else? &gt;Recently there has been a lot of controvery over children saying the pledge in school and specifically the ""under god"" phrase in the pledge. However as a whole, the pledge teaches children respect and patriotism. So we should ignore the less good parts if the whole thing is positively good? Why not change it to make it even more good as a whole? &gt;Without the pledge, children who grow up without ever reciting it may end up less involved in voting and participating in our goverment becuase they simply wont care about the state of our nation. I would like to emphasize that you used the word **may**, probably because there is no way we could make a definitive statement about it. So why do you feel so comfortable assuming it is because of the Pledge of Allegiance? Anyways, the Pledge of Allegiance can be viewed as a fascist remnant of our ""Gung Ho, Patriotism!"" days, and many countries (especially those in some Western European Nations who had to deal with Fascism more than America) find it disturbing that we still practice this. People have incited violence against groups of people who use their constitutional right to *not* say the Pledge of Allegiance, and it is still an issue (though less infringing) for some students in school today. Most children just view the Pledge as ""Patriotic"" and ""The right thing to do"", while other students who don't become selected out and more likely targets for bullying. TL;DR: There is no evidence to suggest that saying something (which many people would argue is radically fascist) like the Pledge of Allegiance has any positive benefit to children, but it does offer a chance for people to be bullied for just doing their constitutional rights.'.

"The argument: 'If you organize a sub-reddit by ""top, all time"" you should be able to click on the top fifty links and see fifty different amazing posts that wowed thousands of people. Agreed? But if the top five are submitted over and over again, then you might only see twenty different original posts in the top fifty. This means that the more thoroughly a sub has been karma-whored, the more its content is effectively lost for all time, because it's not worth going through dozens of pages of a subreddit's history without seeing any original posts. Also, reddit, like many communities that rely on network effects, runs on expectations, trust, and community standards. Karma is puerile, but it's like crack for some people. They are excited to encourage other posters whom they imagine to be innocently searching for and creating content, and are inspired to act in the same way. Put it this way - if you want your content provided for you by cynical trolls who are recycling the same warehouse of links to other people's research and accomplishments with the goal of getting as many clicks as possible, you *already have* the Gawkpire, Huffington, Buzzfeed, and all the rest.

But for there to be an 'opposite' sex, their biological sex has to be a given. If their biological sex matched their mental sex, then they wouldn't be transsexuals, regardless of genitalia or chromosomes. In other words, if I said ""no, this person with a penis was actually born female because that's in their mind,"" and you accepted that, it still wouldn't refute your argument because the person wouldn't be transsexual. Anyway, it's not really relevant outside of a medical context. But that being said, do they biologically become the opposite sex after transition? No surgery has given a male a fully functional uterus or removed any trace of the y-chromosome from their body, nor has it done the reverse for females.

Also, being human may mean the death of the species. There may be a balance we have some part to play in, where we make room for the next phase, so there may be a way in which survival is impossible, at least in that, what we value about surviving from our point of view, may look very different striped of the earth and the nature we take for granted.

None of them.. Basically half the population of the world was dismissed and most of the male half was ok with it. 3) Europeans would come to the americas and oppress natives as an inferior social class at best.. As slaves and servants in many cases, often in name of religion and educating said natives in the ways of god.. 4) The inquisition burning witches, scientists, pagans and homosexuals alive.. Europe is full of castles because everyone back then was expecting their neighbors to invade them while thinking to invade others themselves..

"The argument: '&gt; Basically, If the ""mind"" goes on thinking it's a male, with no body validating it, it will likely lead to a mind with a similar situation of gender dysphoria; distress of being ""born wrong"". Since you acknowledge gender dysphoria, it makes no sense to call out the transgender community as a ""conspiracy to ultimately shed humanity's biological existence,"" because transgender people explicitly do recognize the biological existence. Those who transition only want to swap one type of biological existence for another (male&lt;-&gt;female body), not get rid of it. They're generally only relieved of their gender dysphoria once their body looks like the other sex. Secondly, there are transgender people who don't want or don't feel the need to transition at all. They are also not explained under your hypothesis.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'Here is why Christianity is more reliable than Greek mythology: 1. It does not have a large focus on explaining the natural world, which separates ""religion"" from ""mythology."" 2. Early Christian martyrs would not have realistically died for a lie that they know is wrong. 3. Christianity has specific prophets that claimed to receive revelations, while Greek mythology does not have a claim as to where the knowledge came from. 4. Many bible prophecies were fulfilled and are objective and not open to interpretation, such as Edom becoming a desert, and Babylon controlling Judah for 70 years. 5. Science predictions. Job 26:7 (NIV): ""He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing."" Prediction of space. Keep in mind that some people back then believed in an animal carrying the earth on its back. Ecclesiastes 1:7 (NIV): ""All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again."" Leviticus 11:28 (NIV): ""Anyone who picks up their carcasses must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean till evening. These animals are unclean for you."" Mythology involves weird things like the universe being hatched from eggs and such.

These folks are exercising their right to express their views, but that does not mean that others just have to listen silently without responding.

One of the best quotes I have heard on the topic is ""bad argument gets counterargument. Does not get bullet."" In other words, if people disagree, they should go ahead and express that in a civil, respectful, and reasonable fashion. The bullet here is a way to silence opponents or make them disappear. Examples of crossing the line, in my opinion, would be if the objectors attempted to have the booth banned from campus for example, or to silence the people by ""tattling"" to the authorities and trying to have them academically disciplined or sanctioned, or doxxing or other forms of harassment.

"The argument: '&gt;It's an example of over-diagnosis, and is no longer recognized under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). This change to the DSM came with much outrage of many involved parties. Due to how little we truly understand the involved topics, I would say that just because it isn't in the DSM does not mean it isn't real and doesn't affect people in drastic ways. Mental health in general is a very misunderstood topic in our society. When you say people go to therapy for ""normal problems"" those people very well might be suffering from a slight abnormality in brain function, or slightly abnormal thought patterns. You were correct in saying that ""he went to therapy"" is an invalid argument for placing *all* of the blame on mental health, but it is just as incorrect to say that *none* of the blame can therefore be placed on mental health. The issue is far too complex to be that binary. In reality, I think all of the possible ""causes"" for this shooting are completely co-dependent. You do not develop such a narcissistic and extreme hatred for women without some abnormality in your mental well-being. You also do not develop this hatred without extreme societal pressures (read: cultural misogyny) contributing. They play into each other in an extremely complex fashion, and anyone who tries to take this single case and make it a poster child for their cause is really cheating the complexity of the situation.'.

"The argument: 'It's all well and good to put in writing ""we care about your safety,"" but as a pizza delivery guy for a major chain I know that this doesn't always match reality. I live in the Midwest and have been made to leave on delivery while the tornado sirens are going off. Had I insisted, they may have let me wait until the all clear, but then I would have been marked as ""not a team player"" and probably had my hours cut. There was one time I did refuse to go out: it had been raining hard for hours and there was flash flooding throughout most of our delivery area. Major roads had at least a few inches of water, and some side roads were deep enough that water was starting to leak in under my car doors. Finally, my car nearly stalled and my tires briefly lost contact with the road. I turned around and went back to the store and told my shift manager I wasn't going out again. The other driver and the shift manager both agreed that we needed to close, but the district manager tried everything he could think of short of threats or bribes to keep us on the road. And he was nice; not all managers would have eventually accepted the refusal. My point is I've been in similar (though not as dire) situations, and despite publicly posted concerns about safety, I have enough experience to read between the lines. They promise punishment if you don't follow their guidelines with no regard for extenuating circumstances (like loss of home), and the guidelines they've set don't match the recommendations by the professionals.

You've conceded the point that, on average, STEM majors tend to do better than non-STEM majors, no one is disputing that. But let's look at the bottom rung of STEM majors to see how they are doing. Thanks to Georgetown's [What It's Worth](https://cew.georgetown.edu/report/whats-it-worth-the-economic-value-of-college-majors/) study, we have median salary and unemployment data across a wide range of majors. As expected, lots of the top slots are taken by various STEM fields, like petroleum engineering and computer science. But what about the worst STEM majors? In Biology and Life Sciences, Botany has the worst median salary at 42,000 (with a 3% unemployment rate). The highest unemployment rate is at 8% for Zoology majors. In Physical Sciences, Nuclear Engineering has the lowest median salary at 52,000 (with a 2% unemployment rate). The highest unemployment rate is 9% for Physical Science majors. Remember, this survey was done in 2011, when the national unemployment rate was right around 9%, and the median salary was about 45,000 So, basically, even if you major in the least popular and least marketable STEM major on record, you can still expect to make a median salary and have average unemployment. That's pretty good odds. Never mind that if you have one of these ""bad"" STEM degrees, its relatively easy to train into one of the more lucrative ones.

Below is a bit of context, and a clarifying question. &gt; In the United States, as far as I know, The last time this was brought to the Supreme Court was in 1981 (link below). The Supreme Court decision was basically, ""since only men can fight, it makes sense to only register men"". (I'm not a law scholar, you can read the decision yourself if you are interested). Given that, in the last 30 years, the US military has changed significantly, and women are now fighting in just about every role of the Army, that decision seems ripe to be revisited. However, it won't be automatically changed unless someone does something about it. Someone would need to either challenge the law again, or lawmakers would need to change it. I don't see either happening unless there is a pressing need for the draft to actually be implemented. Laws don't automatically change when the social situation changes. In order for the laws to change you either need someone to challenge the law in the courts and have it overturned, or you need to have a lawmaker invest the political capital in drafting a new law. Both of these courses of actions would require a significant investment of time and material. In the US, since we don't have mandatory military service, the arguments are mostly academic. In countries with mandatory military service, the issue becomes much more interesting, since there is an actual cost to be born by the male citizens.

Thatcher ended the direct aristocratic control of the Unions and of all of the National companies, something which was arguably incredibly beneficial to the great majority of the British people. The other main benefit of her government was that the authoritarian measures of austerity in the UK that had existed since WW2 were ended. State controls of food, land, money, trade and finance were all either abolished or heavily relaxed, allowing for the modernization of Britain. Modern Britain is only able to survive today because of the policies of Thatcher and the creation of a modern economy. If not for Thatchers reforms, I have no doubt that the UK would currently be in the same situation as Greece, with little to no proper industry and little to no available capital. Like it or not, thatchers policies were needed to save Britain from the destructive post war policies it had adhered to for so long. '. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: '&gt;Imo, a dog lover has to be concerned with the welfare of dogs and not just their dog Have you read the American Kennel Club's statement about responsible breeding? ""Every dog is the best dog in the world to its owner. Responsible breeders, however, know to avoid ""kennel blindness"" -- in other words, they take a step back and honestly evaluate the good and bad points of their dogs before making the decision to breed. The goal of breeding, after all, is to produce a better dog and a quality pet."" Not all dog breeders breed purebred animals. Some are breeding dogs just to be better pets. Some specifically work at reversing some of the problems of current breeds through back breeding them. &gt;Why should it matter what lineage of dogs your dog comes from? Well if you are breeding from a dog lineage that is known for being unstable you may want to know that. I had a standard poodle growing up that was incredibly unstable, turns out her parents were also unstable, and came from a line of unstable dogs. We ended up having to give her up to a rescue program because she bit me in the face, if there hadn't been that rescue program we would have had to put her down. If we had known her family past before we got her we may have thought twice for her being around small children. &gt; Why are some traits so important for humans that we essentially practice eugenics on our furry friends? Because a lhasa apso may not be the best breed for a hunting dog, but it also may not be the best around children. What you want out of a dog is important to what dog you get, and some breeds have basically excelled at some traits but not at others. &gt;I will only rescue dogs personally. Thats a noble goal, but sometimes you may not have the time to honestly deal with a rescue dog's baggage. Sometimes you may not want to risk it (say if you have kids), and sometimes you want to raise one from a puppy on up.

Can you provide a source for this claim? &gt;if earth were a ball then skylines and landmarks should disappear over the curve after a few miles. instead they are seen in the horizon from over almost 60 miles.

"The argument: 'True story: I grew up playing school. I always wanted to be a teacher. So I did. But I quickly realized that the job I thought I was getting was very different from the one I had. Long story short: when they placed almost 40 five year olds in my room fit for 20, I had to quit because I felt that I was taking part in an extremely dysfunctional system (which I was) that went against what I knew to be important not only as a professional educator, but also as a citizen and a parent. It hurt. I straight up went through the grieving process dealing with, what I considered at the time, a loss of my career and part of my identity. But I did the work and did the thinking and soul searching and all that shit. I miss teaching. I wish I was teaching right now. But I can't be the kind of teacher I feel good about being in the current climate. Kim Davis is a different story.

Absolutely NO ONE is forcing her to be the clerk. She chose to pursue that. She also decided which parts of the bible she would choose to honor and which parts she would choose to ignore. She also signed, I imagine, a job description. So it seems inevitable to me that she would eventually run into this ""moral dilemma."" She has not been truthful with herself or her county, she has been a blatant hypocrite, and now she want to be seen as some hero? A martyr? I don't think so.

"The argument: 'I can only speak for myself, so I can tell you the problem that I have with it. There are a few facets to it. Firstly, I think it makes people feel like they're helping, when they really aren't. You can talk all you like about the ""power of social media"", but that's basically just an example of what I'm talking about. You changing your profile picture does exactly nothing for anyone. I'm not saying you SHOULD be doing more, because like you said, there's really not much that you CAN do. But there was a time when you accepted that you'd LIKE to be able to help, but that you simply aren't in a position to be able to. Now we've gotten to a point where we think we DID help because we changed a profile picture or re-tweeted something. So I would flip it around and say that the people doing it are the ones with a moral superiority complex. Or at least an inflated ego. I can't help the people in France right now. I know that, and I accept it. I'd love to be able to, but nothing I can feasibly do is going to take away from what happened. So I'm not going to pretend like I made a difference by ""raising awareness"" about something that the entire world knows about. And they don't need my support. It's a given. Every person with a heart in any country on Earth is supportive of the victims of this and empathetic to their families. It doesn't make me special to say that ""I stand with France."" Big deal, so does everyone else. If this were something divisive, like if there were a big fight going on about whether France deserved it, and there were scores of people saying they were happy about what happened, then sure, it would make some sense to say ""Hey guys, we're with you."" But when 99.9% of the developed world is on the same side, then you're really not doing anything by saying you're supportive. It's not for France.

Some things here I just can't ignore: 1) We couldn't care less what the media says or what politicians say. Our job is to find the truth, and that's what we do. If you don't like how Washington reacts to it, or how the media portrays it, that doesn't invalidate the science. 2) Weather and climate are entirely different concepts, and understanding that is step 1. The fact that we can't predict the ""weather"" in 10 days has no bearing on our ability to say whether it's going to be warmer in 50 years. We're not trying to tell you the forecast for rain on Oct. 3, 2075, so that's really not a good comparison. I can tell you with some pretty solid confidence that it's going to be warmer in July than it was today. 3) Never mention Al Gore around us. To even lump him in is simply a distraction from the actual science. 4) There have been warmer periods, and with more CO2. The extent is not the concern right now, it's the rate at which it's happening. Previous warmings have taken tens to hundreds of thousands of years. This time it has taken less than a century. The planet simply cannot adapt that quickly. That's the problem. If it took 10,000 years, we'd be just fine. That's slow enough that species (including us) can adapt with the changing climate. 5) The thing you've said about the sun is just patently false. The solar variation accounts for a miniscule fraction of observed warming. 6) The ""hockey stick"" is not a prediction. It's observation (i.e. it's already happened), so no, that's not a problem with models. Yes, the modeled future continues that same path, but it's already happening. 7) The urban heat island effect only affects a handful of stations around the planet, and that's accounted for in the climate summary.

You then USE those skills to go apply them and learn more abstract things like how to figure the total cost of a mortgage, how to decide whether to itemize your taxes, etc. Remember that people have actual college degrees in how to prepare taxes. How are they going to teach that to high schoolers in a single semester?'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'Are there cases of drunken sex that *aren't* rape? Yes. Most couples probably have sex while drunk at some point. Where is the line drawn, then? I think it's tough to say and to some degree should be a case-by-case thing. As you say, if you're drunk to the point of being unable to communicate or if you're barely conscious then you absolutely can't give consent. If you're less drunk then the other details of the ""encounter"" come in to play. How coercive/aggressive/forceful was the other party? In some cases drunk sex is fairly ""mutual"" while in others there is an ""aggressor"" or instigator. Did you feel uncomfortable or like you were being forced in to it, but felt it was easier at the time to just ""go along with it,"" or perhaps said no but were pressured in to it? If you're stumbling drunk but able to make conscious choices, and someone asks if they can have your phone, then they run away with it, they still robbed you. You didn't freely ""choose"" to give them your phone - it was still a violation and a crime. Regarding the drunk driving comparison, the obvious difference there is that drunk driving is a choice someone actively makes, whereas rape is something that happens to people. That's why if you drunkenly commit rape you're liable, but if you drunkenly *are* raped you're not. Same with contracts. It's my understanding that if you sign a contract drunk it can be considered invalid, though I'm not sure exactly where the lines are in those cases.'.

A common retort from the pro-life side is that adoption is always an option, but clearly that's not true, or we wouldn't have kids sitting in foster care for years upon years (especially true if the kid is unfortunate enough to not be white). So, in many cases, regardless of how it happened, the choice is literally between a horrible life of poverty, a horrible life of being passed around between foster families for an entire childhood, or just putting a stop to it before it ever happens. When a 17 year old girl in the inner city gets pregnant (doesn't matter how), there's no good outcome. And since there's no good outcome, the best choice becomes whichever one is the least damaging in the long run, and that's where I'd argue that you're doing the best thing you can by putting this ""child"" out of its misery before it ever starts.

"The argument: '&gt; not very efficient when it comes to altruistic pursuits and a lot of moonshot technologies that many of us would like see the light of day By altruistic pursuits I'll assume you mean things that governments would often provide such as basic income, state funded healthcare, universal education etc, although correct me if I misunderstood. Public goods like defence, and merit goods like education are very often underproduced, or even not produced at all by the free market system, and have been identified as causing market failure. Pretty much every government in developed countries therefore attempts to provide or partially provide these in some way, which means that the free market is no longer fully responsible for their provision. Better income inequality has also been identified as beneficial for a country, and so lots of governments provide benefits and welfare payments. Basically, I'm saying that these issues are already being addressed by governments and not many people argue for their provision through a purely capitalist system, because it pretty clearly wouldn't work as well. In terms of moonshot technology, recently big corporations with lots of spare cash like Apple and Google have been working on ambitious technological projects that will provide benefits to the world in the future. Their incentive to take on these projects is the prospect of being able to dominate important future markets, and hence make vast amounts of money. So I think that there are examples of moonshot technologies being researched by firms purely because of a profit incentive. Also, because governments have such difficult decisions to make about how to spend their budgets, I think it's unlikely that they would devote much of their spending towards moonshot projects that might only have an impact in the distant future, and could completely fail.

There are a great many people, myself included, who disagree with you about the size. I do think that our military should be much smaller, but I'll accept your position for the purpose of this CMV. Even if we were to agree that the military needs to remain as strong and influential as it is, why does that immediately imply that their budget must remain the same. Nearly every government agency deals with budget cuts, and they find a way to continue operating at the same level of professionalism and skill. Why must the military be given a $650 billion blank check every year, without anyone questioning whether the money could be spent more efficiently? And if you know how the federal budget ""works"", then you'll see why this is a problem. As long as money is given to them, it will be spent, because to NOT spend it means that it will probably get taken away next year. Budget surplus is a bad word in the land of federal agencies. This isn't unique to the military, but if you want an agency to spend less, the only way to accomplish that is to take it away, and FORCE them to make the changes necessary to do the same job with less money.

There is an argument that in a single economy that all washes out, but these are multinational companies. If that business goes bankrupt, the tax payer is now liable. Most sinister of all, a nationalized oil industry creates direct dependance. The government will factor the revenue and expenses into the federal budget, and plan based on that revenue. Where a government gets its tax dollars from is irrelevant as long as it flows, but now you have a situation where the government has a financial interest in perpetuating fossil fuels. It's easy to say, well, just harvest less oil! That means laying people off, creating unemployment, and a host of other issues.

We all paid for the college of people who took out those loans, in ADDITION to our OWN college. You will not gather much public support to simply forget all of that, when we all paid for our own. Regarding making universities free: They basically just become longer high school at that point. If everyone is going, and it's ""free"", the quality is going to suffer, and people are going to migrate to private universities anyway if they want a quality education, so a degree from a public university will diminish in value and be viewed basically like a community college degree is now. Ultimately, the bottom line is that it's time we stop treating people under 30 as children who got ""tricked"" into taking out student loans. Take some responsibility for your actions and decisions.

"The argument: 'I understand the dissonance described, however it is not established why it would be wrong to date someone if there is physical attraction. For that to be considered objectively or subjectively wrong there has to be a philosophical basis for it that goes beyond the individual feeling that it is ""wrong"". So if you, OP, were adhering to a a certain set of world views such as one of the common world religions, you could say, ""I feel it is wrong to date someone because of physical attractiveness because (example) Proberbs 30 states 'Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.' "" That would be the philosophical basis if you believed there is absolute authority in those writings. Alternatively, maybe you have other prejudices against people you are physically attracted to? Such as you believing that if they are attractive they will cheat on you, or that their attractiveness necessarily must make the girl dumb? Perhaps you don't think you are attractive enough to be in the same ""league"" as people you find attractive? Could it be some irrational fear like that?'.

You can be pro-life because your religion says so, because you think life begins at conception and abortion is murder, or because you believe that people should have to deal with the consequences of their actions. Now, some might say if you are pro life, you must be anti-death penalty. But maybe your religion says nothing about capital punishment, or you care about personal responsibility and consequences, which are perfectly consistent with supporting the death penalty. But if you believe A, B and C because of principle 1, and principle 1 dictates that you should also believe Z, then yes, you should believe Z as well or else you haven't thought through your justifications sufficiently.'.

However, for the people who didn't, I think it was that they were too attached to the land in those six counties to just up and leave like that. They had lived there for hundreds of years, and they probably didn't want to say ""yeah, we lost, let's pack up and go"". A lot of people think that this is tantamount to surrender, which is the ultimate shame. Let's turn this around. Why didn't Irish Protestants simply move to England, if the IRA was so hellbound on returning Ulster to the Republic? For probably the same reason, they didn't want to surrender and they didn't want to give up on land that had been in their family for hundreds of years.

"The argument: 'I think what you're running into is what is defined by ""Lawful."" I personally like the definition based on the personality section in classic DnD. I know that seems like it's the worse place to get a definition, but hear me out: &gt;A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs her. Order and organization are paramount to her. She may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government. Now going under this, we have the concept that Lawfulness is defined by a personal or outside set of rules that people follow. Libertarians are following a personal code of conduct that dictate the government not be given exceptions to the rules that the citizens follow. Obviously if we defined Lawful as something that is defined under the government alone we would come to the conclusion that the government is lawful. But we need to use the definition of Lawful that they use in order to come to that same conclusion. If the government had to follow the same rules as it's citizens, would it be unlawful for the government to collect taxes without prior asking to sign an agreement with that person? I think so.'.

There were 562k deaths in the 50 years before that. The modern era has seen unprecedented peace among the world powers. A large part of that has to do with the modern weapon systems. I'm no fan of the Iraq and Afghan wars, but between the two of them, the US suffered under 7,000 casualties. Obviously, there are serious questions about how the wars (and more importantly, the aftermath of the wars) were handled, but there can be no doubt that other countries with a grudge against the US can't help but look at how much the US could do with so few casualties and do the math. Fewer countries willing to attack the US or its Allies (or Russia or China for similar reasons) means fewer wars, and those that there are tend to be small skirmishes. While it's possible that there are diplomatic means that could have achieved the same results, it's hard to argue that, given the current geopolitical reality, you haven't saved lives.'.

I'm not sure how you feel about firefighters, but to me, someone who has said, ""you can count on me to run in to burning building to save a stranger's life"" deserves respect. Now, personally, he might be an assholes who beats his wife and steals from the blind beggar, and if he were my neighbor I'd want nothing to do with him. But I respect his job, and the fact that he'd do something for the good of the public that I wouldn't do means something. Now think about soldiers. They have signed up to let the government, even one they don't approve of (which is particularly the case for most of the soldiers in the US) decide how to use them, even if that means putting them at great risk of death. You may disagree with some of the recent US/UK foreign policy decisions - many in the military do too. But it wouldn't work to have a military where the soldiers get to vote whether they feel like getting deployed. Do you dispute the need for a military? If we unilaterally disarmed and demobilized every soldier, do you think that China wouldn't instantly take Taiwan, North Korea wouldn't head south and Iran wouldn't do whatever they wanted? Regardless of whether you agree with recent military actions, if you agree you need an army, then you need soldiers willing to die. Are they idiots? Well, are firemen? They don't know why the fire started, whether the homeowner was a good person. They just know that there is a job to do, that society needs to be done.

But then what older work would you not want somebody to be so concerned? Also, I'm not sure that the expression of ""to seek out new life and new civilizations"" necessarily carries the connotations to which you attribute it, but merely reflects an appropriate phrasing without being necessarily explicit.

He saw someone he recognized, and said something like, ""Hey, Tom, how come I never see you and Betsy around anymore?"" Tom was flabbergasted - McCarthy had called him out as a Communist, ruining his life. [I forget the actual name of the person - it was in the book ""Senator Joe McCarthy"" by Richard Rovere which i read many years ago] McCarthy wasn't being a troll, he honestly didn't get the connection between the stuff he did on the stage and the real people whose lives he burned to the ground. Does that make him a ""nice guy""? Yeah, I believe Trump both when he says he loves Mexicans, and when he attacks them. He's quite capable of holding contradictory ideas at the same time. Like the Queen in Alice, ""Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."" Perhaps, as with McCarthy, he is without malice personally.

However, knowing the news of the nuclear reactor explosion a few miles upwind, the approaching hurricane, or the water main break that will leave you without water for a week are very timely. Sports news is very short lived- except for championships, no one cares about the results of a game a week or two ago.

And of course Orwell feared that, seeing the measures the UK had taken during WWII, they could be heading down the same path. But while the details have changed, human nature hasn't. Plays like Henry V and Richard III were written about a very different time, yet are still relevant, because when you expose leaders to power the same things happen. The NSA is a far, far cry from the thought police, but it's helpful to have 1984 as a reminder of where unchecked government surveillance can lead. We don't go as far as ""War is Peace"" and ""Freedom is Slavery"" today, but Orwell brilliantly predicted how language can be twisted and shaped - rebranding an ""inheritance tax"" as a ""death tax"" suddenly makes it evil, the demonizing of the word ""socialism"", ""pro-choice"" vs. ""pro-life"". All politicians these days are about ""staying on message"", so the message becomes the reality. Also, I don't know how old you are, so I don't know how much of the aftermath on 9/11 (particularly in the US) you were aware of at the time. But people were scared, and were perfectly prepared to turn over a lot of freedom for a little security. Bush moved in that direction (which lead us down the path to the current NSA abuses) but didn't go too far. If there had been another attack, and a president who believed in security at any cost, the US would have been much closer to 1984 than it currently is.

"The argument: 'Someone will do a more thorough comment on sure, but much of what we think of as ""radical Islam"" is modern, arising after the 1950s in response to secular, nationalist tyrants backed by the United States and the Soviet Union during our Cold War chess match. Many Middle East countries at the time were led by royals or socialist tyrants backed by one of the two great powers. As citizens of these countries braced against what they say as subjugation by the West and East, many rebels embraced Islam as a counter to either the secular statism of the east or the liberalism of the west; seeing this, the U.S. and Soviet Union often enabled the radical rebels in the other country's client states, providing arms or instruction in order to undermine their rival. This is an oversimplification, but the idea is that, for instance, until 1973 Afghanistan was backed by a royal leader friendly with the west. He was ousted in a socialist coup supported by the Soviet Union. The Afghan mujahideen formed in reaction to this and embraced Islam as a counter to this secular, socialist leader. We helped support and supply the mujahideen in order to undermine Soviet interests in the area, and did manage to cost the Soviet Union greatly when they invaded Afghanistan. '.

"The argument: 'At 20, I didn't want kids. I thought I'd be a lousy parent, I didn't really see the point, and the concept scared the crap out of me. At 26, my son was born (and his sister 4 years later). They were the best thing that ever happened to me. First, you become bigger than yourself. It's an awesome responsibility, but an amazing opportunity, to navigate through the lify-ness of life and try to end up with decent children. You also get to redo a bunch of firsts. I'm sure that even if you like fireworks (or rainbows, or any other thing of stunning beauty), you're pretty calm about it. But when your kid sees it for the first time, you get to re-appreciate that wonder. The same goes for introducing them to your favorite movie, book, tv show, dessert or whatever. My son is now in college. He's become such an amazing young man - I think a lot of it is just him being who he is, but we at least didn't screw him up too badly. In a world filled with asshats, it's nice to think that you helped the other team. No, you shouldn't have kids now. You're too young, and you aren't ready. And since I don't know you, I can't say whether you ever will be. But I can tell you that just because you don't want them now doesn't mean that you won't want them later. And the fact that you're giving it this much thought is a good sign that if you DO decide to have kids that you'll go into it thoughtfully, with a conscious desire to make sure you screw up as little as possible.'.

"The argument: 'As someone who has made online friends across the world that has included having them travel and stay with me - I completely understand your point of view. The people we spend hours with in our spare time online are real people, who have real emotions and real time constraints - wasting their time is just as relevant as wasting any other persons time. With that out the way, one still needs to understand the context of differing events in your life. Your bowling league is not as important as your anniversary, so even when we discuss real life events we understand that some things are more or less important than other events. So where does online gaming compare to your bowling league - are they the same? I would argue not. You see, the reason we do events like this is to have fun, but also to meet people and have camaraderie. These aren't things that you get from online games in general as the person is generally anonymous and secondly is able to put on a show and change their personality. When you put off events with friends for your online activities - you're giving off the impression that you value your faceless online friends over the people who are there for you in real life, and ultimately would be the people you would call on and rely on in times of emergency. Probably the issue that society does see with online events, is that they are generally addictive and thus what is considered'reasonable' for rescheduling has a very different meaning when you're the one doing the rescheduling compared to those who are being inconvenienced. Online gaming should be seen for what it is by those that partake in it (myself included) as a hobby where (generally) superficial relationships are made, but are not a replacement for face-to-face life commitments and friendships.'.

"The argument: 'When you are talking about staging plays or casting movies, I don't have any problem with a (well executed) female Hamlet, an Asian Othello or a wheelchair-bound Henry V. You're taking a well known, and extensively analyzed text and using it to look at things from a different perspective, which can be brilliant. But there are still fresh productions being made with the ""standard"" interpretation - so you aren't losing anything, just getting something new to consider. Comics can be different. My dad was a kid in WWII, and he read the adventures of Steve Rogers as Captain America. As a kid I read about Peter Parker, and together we saw the only real James Bond, Sean Connery. The creators have a tough task. On the one hand they need to preserve the spirit of the original character, and letting the long-time fan-boys and girls revel in the off-hand comments that are only understood by those immersed in the character's history. On the other, if you read a comic from the 40's or 50's, it's incredibly dated and unsophisticated. You need to keep it interesting and relevant to capture new readers- which means Jimmy Olson, newsboy, doesn't really have a place in 2014. Honestly, I think the people complaining loudest are those like me - who used to be loyal readers, but based on time, money and life priorities have drifted away. I like the fact that, 20 years after dropping comics, I can still get most of the references in the recent batch of movies. But if you mess around with the characters and their histories, I lose that connection, which saddens me. Especially since once they've killed Steve Rogers, or made Thor female, there aren't new stories being made with the characters I'd loved. I wouldn't say I'm ""offended"", and I even understand why they do it, but it still feels like they are bulldozing the park you played at when you were a kid.

Foreign policy is a dance between what we say we do, and what we're actually doing. There's all sorts of public posturing that is covering all sorts of behind the scenes sleight of hand.

Not saying that's all bad, but it changes the game. &gt;Why wouldn't you get IBM to run Healthcare.gov from the start? Because there is a convoluted bidding process to try to keep the system from being corrupted. You can't just say ""IBM will do a good job, we'll just pick them"".

That said, the city where he taught had a lot of immigrants. He had some brilliant students who were not only putting themselves through school, but also supporting their families. I know of one at least who went on to get a doctorate at MIT. To imply that students at the ""better"" school are universally ""better"" is unfounded. As other have said, there are ways to raise your GPA by taking less challenging classes at the ""better"" school.

If you are willing to assault and violate another person for sexual gratification, then you are not a moral person and you are willing to do great evil to get your own way. A rape victim did not do evil, nor does a rape victim intend evil. Only a rapist is responsible for rape, and yes, it is offensive to suggest that a rape victim is responsible for such a horrible and immoral act. A person, whether a woman or a man, can do things which increase the statistical chances that they will be the victim of rape, that's true. They can leave their house without a chaperone. They can show their ankles. They can enter a romantic relationship. They can have consensual sex. They can drink alcohol. They can start a conversation with a stranger. All of these things might increase the chances they will be a victim of crime, but their decision to live their life as they see fit can never make them responsible for someone else's decision to harm them. People can decide for themselves how much they are willing to restrict their lives out of fear of the wrongdoing of others.

In that case, there is a lot of room for being more open minded.

The same thing can certainly hold true between adults. If someone is proud that they ran 10k, even though I'm a marathon runner, I can still say ""good for you"" and mean it sincerely. The first person isn't boasting - they know I'm better at it than they are, but that doesn't mean that I can't acknowledge their accomplishment, and again, share in their joy.

The Minnesota abomination, on the other hand has note of the benefit. Clearly, a gray duck is still a duck. A child would be correct to say, ""duck, duck, duck"". No, all it does it teach that we should be aware of color distinctions, and that somehow, despite being a duck in every way, ""gray ducks"" should be singled out for special treatment.

"The argument: 'There is certainly some truth in your argument. The rise of the American middle class in the 50s and 60s was largely based on manufacturing jobs where the unions had negotiated good wages. Globalization has moved most manufacturing offshore. But that's not the whole story. The top federal income tax rate in 1944 was 94% at an 2011 equivalent of $2.5mm. In 1981, it was 70% at the equivalent of $532,000. It's now 39.6% at $388k equivalent. That's a pretty massive difference. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#History_of_top_rates) On the other end of the spectrum, from 1956-1982, the Federal Minimum wage ranged from $5.42 to $7.21 in 1996 dollars, averaging somewhere in the $6.00 range. Since then, it hasn't broken $5.30 and hit a low of $4.04, averaging probably around $4.75 (again, all in 1996 dollars). http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0774473.html That link you gave doesn't really support your argument when you get beyond the headline: &gt; When factoring in state and local taxes, the top 10% pay just under half the tab. And when calculating tax burden as a percent of income, the tax code is even less progressive. The top 10% paid an average of 30% of their income in local, state, and federal taxes in 2011, said McIntyre. That's not much different than the 25% percent paid by the middle class. &gt;""The system is a little progressive, but not much,"" McIntyre said. &gt;Still, the wealthy are paying more taxes on a federal level simply because they are making so much more money. The top 10% of taxpayers take home 45% of the nation's income, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. Moreover, they seem to be getting richer all the time.

"The argument: 'If you try and look at gun control in isolation it's quite clear that in some countries gun control is the perfect solution! Take England for example, England has quite strict gun control (handguns illegal, some shotguns can be owned by farmers, no concealed carry) and most years there is **less than 50 gun homicides**! Less than 50! Over 50,000,000 people and less than 50 die because of guns. Take a look at America, limited gun control in most places and quite a few places have concealed carry / open carry and there's roughly 10,000 gun homicides per year! Looking at that alone should instantly demonstrate to you that gun control prevents the majority of homicides, right? England has a population of about 50 million and 50 gun homicides, America has a population of 300 million and 10,000 gun homicides, even if you adjust for population figures the difference is staggering. Yet that's obviously not true, just restricting guns doesn't suddenly stop homicides because you're from a country where it's the opposite! So what's the difference between England and Puerto Rico and America? Why does gun control work in England, not work in Puerto Rico and no gun control doesn't work in America? I can't change your view regarding the value of gun control but you need to look elsewhere for the answers to your question about violent crime, gun control is just one small piece of the violent crime puzzle, violent crime is a social issue, it's not a crime of opportunity, and social issues are a part of culture, they're affected by history and attitudes, they're things that cannot be solved by a law or two and they're things that, in some cases, can never be solved. I live in England, there are people with guns here but I have never in my life seen a gun, most police officers are unarmed and I feel very safe. I've never been frightened for my life, someone could theoretically break into my house tomorrow with a gun and I'd have no way to defend myself, so why am I not scared? I don't think that will happen, because guns are so very hard to come by here, because why would someone want to shoot me? because I've been brought up not to live in fear, because",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],3.0,True,False,Social Science and Humanities,"Security: personal,Security: societal"

They have had good seasons, but there have also had some dreadful teams over the years. Yet many fans stayed with them throughout it all. While they sucked, there was a bond formed among the faithful - that they were the few, the noble sufferers, the Charlie Browns who could somehow after every crappy season say, ""Wait'il Next Year""! The is something admirable about being able to keep that faith, about knowing your heart is going to be broken time after time, but still you believe. I grew up as a Red Sox fan, and while they didn't suck like the Pirates, you KNEW they would blow it somehow. Time after time, they'd figure out a new way to make us believe and then trample on our hearts. But as we learned in 2004, and the Cubs fans learned last year, and yes, even Pittsburgh fans who have stayed faithful will learn one day, the suffering does make it even sweeter when that championship eventually comes.

"The argument: 'First, of course there are already laws in place for accessories and accomplices to be charged. So, if these family members were in any way involved, they can indeed be prosecuted. But what you are proposing would require two sets of facts to be established: 1. The terrorist exhibited observable behaviors that established that they were a threat 2. The family member observed these behaviors and a reasonable person would have interpreted them as a threat. For number one, exactly what behaviors would establish that? Checking out a web site? Being gone during the day? Hanging out with other young angry people? Buying a gun? All of these things are very common activities. Yes, a family member might have wondered what was going on and being concerned, but if every parent who was concerned about a brooding teen called Homeland Security, we'd need a whole lot more agents. As for the second, how are you going to know what a family member observed? Given the constitutional protections against self-incrimination, you'd need to have a third party who observed the family member observing the behavior or checking the web history. How likely is that? Finally, do you really think it's realistic to expect the family to turn them in if they weren't blatantly talking about the crime they were planning to commit (and again, even then, who is going to testify that the terrorist said that)? Parents are notorious for thinking the best of their kids. They are going to be the last ones to believe that their kids are planning to blow someone up. Or they'll talk to them and be assured by their child that, no, of course they would never do that.

I never had a traumatic past or anything particularly devastating affect me, it's more that, apparently, something in my physiology just isn't working the way others' does. Thing is, at least mentally, it's worth making an attempt because there are many, many other choices out there, and you should still definitely do what you can to minimize your feelings of anguish - exercise and a good diet can make an otherwise mediocre medication come out on top, and can completely undermine medication if not done properly. That and being healthy is nice. As others have said,your best bet is to talk with a professional. A good one is going to spend a good bit of time with you, and it's good to be open about what all in your life could be exacerbating your feelings.

"The argument: 'Yep, kids/teens that age don't have the same experiences that you do. And, generally, have less experience, simply due to the difference in the amount of time that they have been alive. But, teens don't have a monopoly on ill-informed. A quick review of talk radio in the United States (and presumably elsewhere) quickly demonstrates that there's no shortage of ignorance among adults either. But there's a difference- most teens, at least the ones worth bothering with, are still learning. Yes, they feel passionate in their beliefs- but they are also more likely to be open to changing their views in the light of evidence. Moreover, most thoughtful adults have been beaten in to accepting a world of greys, where some things can't be changed, and need to be accepted. But often teens believe in justice, and right and wrong, and getting off their ass and DOING something. This is incredibly valuable, both for themselves, society, and for adults, who often can be jolted out of our sedentary lives by their passion. I'm not sure which of their concerns you find ""mind-numbingly irrelevant and unimportant"". My 17 year old son and his friends worked to pass gay marriage here in Minnesota, care about politics and human rights, and create great music. Sure, some of the ""daily life of a high school student"" is trivial, but so is ""the daily life of an office worker"" to those who aren't living it. I don't think my frustrations with my boss are any more unimportant than his frustrations with his teacher. But I think the biggest problem is that you condescend to anyone. I'm a pretty smart guy with a good job and a degree from a great college. But the guy who picks up the trash in my office knows things that I don't, and has insights that I wouldn't have.

If I were wrongly incarcerated, I suspect that I'd opt for experimentation if it got me out sooner. It would really suck if I died from it before exonerating evidence were found. Terminally ill people already participate in controlled clinical trials even though they know it's unlikely to help them personally. Next, how do you assess the ""price"" to pay for each experiment?

"The argument: '&gt;Tell me this wouldn't work It wouldn't work. First, your ""signed commitments"" aren't legally binding, so you can forget them as soon as the candidate is elected, because they sure will. Candidates sign pledges all the time now (the Grover Norquist pledge, the ""no-tax-hike"" pledge, the clean water pledge, etc.), and little if anything actually comes from them. Sure, they pay lip service to the pledge, but nothing more. Then when the next election rolls around, there is always some ""legitimate"" reason why it was the other ""party's fault"", and they ""tried their best to honor their commitment"", and if you could just go ahead and make that check out to ""Jo Blow for Congress"", I promise we'll get 'em this time.

But if it's friends, well, it's an important part of who you are, and they can be better friends if they have the information to know what you've been through. I'm also not a big fan of lying, because it ends up being a lot of work and stress. I don't know how long you went to college, or whether it was in a different city or what, but there might be situations arise when you're with people you haven't told. Maybe you run into someone you knew at college, or mention a restaurant you ate at there, or a book that you read for class, and suddenly, you're scrambling to explain the contradiction. As for mental illness, no doubt that there's a stigma, but I think you'd be surprised to find how how many people (or their sister/brother/mother/friend/etc) have had issues.

In particular there are repetitive posts and much of the subreddit becomes echo chambers of one side or the other as people don't just want to share their view without actually having a discussion. Not to mention that the posts here are complex. On ELI5 you can see a post asking what causes an itch and then find an answer, or on Star Wars you find a post titled ""Jar Jar in Rogue One Leaked Pics"" and then you spend 30 seconds browsing it. Whereas here you find a post that interests you and it requires 10 minutes to do anything with it because you either have to make a comment or else search through and read the arguments.

"The argument: 'Let me make two arguments here: **Unionizing as a right.** Regardless of whether it's a public or private organization, employers have a responsibility to deliver their services as cheaply as possible. You can frame it more charitable - the less they pay on salaries and benefits, the more resources they have for textbooks or computers or services or new busses, etc - but no organization has an incentive to pay more than is required. Except in the rare cases where there is unique (or at least very unusual) skills involved, individual employees have very little leverage. But collectively, they can be a more powerful force. Forget about formal unions, do you really think it's wrong for all of the teachers in a certain district who haven't gotten a raise in 5 years to say, ""If we don't get one, then we aren't going to keep teaching"". Because at the root, that's all a union is - a group of workers who know that while they might fire one troublemaker, firing most of their workers isn't as easy. **Bad for the people they serve** Yes, strikes are bad for people who need services that are not being provided. But striking has also accomplished things like: * Smaller classes * Better resources * Fewer hours in high stress jobs * Better safety conditions Moreover, if you want to attract and retain the best candidates, you need certain benefits and salaries. While School Boards may be simply trying to win votes by cutting expenses/taxes, there could be long-term consequences based on teachers leaving. The threat of strike puts pressure on them to provide competitive offers. This isn't to say unions don't have problems, but I don't think they are the ones you laid out.'.

"The argument: 'The bigger problem is that in our country employers don't have to pay a living wage. If you had a real paycheck, you could afford to rent at least a room in a house. The issue with health care is that all it takes is one single injury or illness to cause personal bankruptcy. Let's say on your way to work you trip and fall, breaking a bone. Even a minor injury like that could easily ring up $10,000 bill. The health care providers can go after you and attach your wages. This means even if you did have an apartment, you may lose it when your paycheck is suddenly smaller. Any credit rating you had is gone. You are are financially ruined for many years to come I have a friend who is young and healthy. He found health insurance too costly (this is before the affordable care act). He has a mishap on his motorcycle and nobody else was at fault. He had over half a million dollars in medical bills. A person in his situation risks losing his home and everything else unless he files for personal bankruptcy. Once bankrupt, you're very likely not to have have the credit score to get even a rent controlled apartment. I encourage you to talk to your social services office. You may be eligible for subsidized housing now. You do not necessarily need to have kids to be eligible for food stamps, rent help, etc. Churches and shelters often offer showers even if they can't offer enough beds. Truck stops also offer pay per use showers. Laundromats are where you'll have to wash clothes even if you had an apartment. I know it's not the norm but some employers would work with you if they knew your situation. They might let you come in early to clean up, or offer some other resources. '.

[According to Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx): &gt;More than nine in 10 adults say they already have children, are planning to have children, or wish that they had had children. The 5% of American adults who do not want children I think it's also fair to argue that having children gives you more of a stake in the future - a politician is aware that the decisions that they make today may impact their children and grandchildren, which should make them think longer term. Do you have an example of political families ""act in ways that benefit them but detrimentally affect the population they govern""? It would help to have specifics to discuss. How about cases of ""preventing more qualified but unrelated candidates from reaching positions of power""? Regardless of how you feel about their politics, both Hilary Clinton and Jeb Bush have as strong or stronger qualifications than most of the other candidates. There also hasn't been a case that I'm aware of at least in America of a family member being taken hostage and impacting policy. Finally, why do we need rules? We have the ability to vote (and such voting was exercised against Jeb Bush, despite his advantages).

In the first study, movie violence and homicide rates are examined across the 20th century and into the 21st (1920–2005). Throughout the mid-20th century small-to-moderate correlational relationships can be observed between movie violence and homicide rates in the United States. This trend reversed in the early and latter 20th century, with movie violence rates inversely related to homicide rates. In the second study, videogame violence consumption is examined against youth violence rates in the previous 2 decades. Videogame consumption is associated with a decline in youth violence rates. Results suggest that societal consumption of media violence is not predictive of increased societal violence rates.

"The argument: '&gt; manslaughter criminalizes the consequences of an individual’s actions rather than the actions themselves. This isn't exactly true, because the legal standard for determining manslaughter is not simply ""Did the person die?"" The evidence used to prove manslaughter will be used to prove your actions warrant manslaughter. &gt; If two different people are who are equally inebriated both decide to make a 12 mile drive at rush hour in New York, but one hits and kills a pedestrian and the other is stopped by the police, they face very different consequences. Yes. And so did the victims. In a DUI case, the victim is society at-large. The consequence they faces was having a drunk driver on the road. If the driver kills someone, the victim is 1) society, for having a drunk driver on the road, and 2) the person who was hit by the car and died. By your logic, the consequences for the driver should be the same in each case because their ""actions"" were the same. However, **this line of thinking requires you to admit that hitting the person in the street was not an action at all**, and merely a consequence of the act of driving drunk. The manslaughter law is applied because there was an additional action taken (the action of hitting someone with a car). So while there is a specific consequence required to charge someone with manslaughter (someone dies), that is not proof the crime occurred. To prove the crime occurred, you must prove the ACTIONS of the defendant caused the death.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

If people never die, scarcity of resources will become a problem until it reaches a point that no one would be allowed to be born.

"The argument: '&gt;It would remove any indication of wealthy vs poor families. &gt;It would also cost less money in the long run as parents would only need to buy a few uniforms as their children would worry less about fashion and popular styles. It also teaches children how to follow the most basic sets of societal guidelines and shows kids how to dress in a professional way. - Dressing in a professional way depends on the uniform. Some schools have kilt/skirt options that female students liked to roll up. An example of my uniform: black pants, baggy pullover sweater, polo shirt. - Not sure if it would cost less money in the long run. It was $60 for 1 pair of pants, $40 for one polo shirt, etc. At a good sale elsewhere it was $10/pair of pants and $5/shirt. School did uniform checks as well where they would have students stand as the teacher looked at the tag to make sure it was the uniform brand of clothing (defeats purpose if everyone could substitute items). - Wear and tear on costly uniform items show income situation of students. A poorer student would have 1 pair of larger pants where the hem is unrolled every couple of years to accommodate growth. 3 years on the color may fade etc, rips are patched... With less expensive pants they could be replaced with less strain on a family's income. - Hand me down uniforms from an older sibling to a younger sibling with signs of wear would also be indicative of income. - Uniform items also tend to have the school logo embroidered on. You could wear a plain white polo elsewhere, but it is awkward to wear a uniform polo elsewhere. The items cost more but have less versatility. - This really depends on the school, but my school also used the students' desire to not wear uniforms as a means to make money which undermines the argument that they are meant to reduce observable differences in income and increase productivity. They'd have no uniform days where students pay $1 to participate and get to wear their regular clothes. '. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'First, anecdote for anecdote, I'm a lot older than you, and have gotten the flu shot at least 20-30 times, and have only gotten ""the flu"" a couple of times. But let's look at what might have happened with you. 1. We tend to call any ""fever, cough, feeling like we've been run over by a bus, vomiting"" disease ""the flu"", but there are many other causes for those symptoms than influenza. Not sure what happened with you in particular and it very well might have been a different virus (and, frankly, docs don't tend to put a lot of effort into diagnosing which viral infection is it since the treatment, such as it is, is pretty much the same anyhow). 2. Because of the time it takes to manufacture and distribute the shots, immunologists have to ""guess"" which flu strains are going to flare up and put them into the shot. Sometimes they are right, sometimes an H1N1 pops up. But saying ""I'm not going to wear a bullet proof vest because a headshot can still kill me"" is silly - some protection is better than no protection. 3. Those are some reasons it might not have prevented it. But you're thinking that the flu shot *caused* your flu. That's simply not possible. The shots use ""dead"" flu viruses. This allows your immune system to identify what a flu virus looks like, and produce antibodies that will be ready to recognize the virus and respond a lot faster. It's almost like distributing ""airplane spotter guides"" to your anti-aircraft defenses so that they can recognize an enemy plane and attack immediately, rather than having to call back to headquarters for confirmation while the plane enters your territory. The flu mist uses ""attenuated"" viruses - they are still ""live"" but rendered unable to harm you. So, there are essentially only benefits to getting the shot.

So they made a proclamation that concentration camp tattoos were an exception. It was something that was done to them, not done by them. The same applies in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and other Eastern religions that support vegetarianism. You aren't supposed to eat meat, but if someone prepares a dish that has a little bit of animal in it, and you eat it unknowingly, it's ok. The same logic applies to Christianity and most other religions. The spirit of the law is more important than the literal interpretation. In the same way, Muslims say you are only a sinner if you sin intentionally and knowingly. So if you unknowingly eat pork, it's fine. Also, if you are on a desert island and the only food available was pork, you are also allowed to eat it. &gt; If you make them commit a sin by touching them with pork after they have committed their attack, they will not enter heaven. So that's not true. If they do something that is morally right and incidentally get pork on themselves during the process, it's ok. Of course, in this example, they consider murdering innocent people to be morally just, which is absurd, but it's still consistent with their logic. This pork thing might still work though. Most Muslims who are murdering others don't know much about the laws of the religion or have a very strange interpretation of it.

It is an emotion like any other, and I don't see why people who aren't able to cope with it are given an easier ride because of this. The *illnesses* of depression and anxiety are not the same as emotions. A common argument is ""Everyone get's sad"" and ""Everyone worried about that important test"". Depression, the illness, will often be described not as feeling sad, but simply a lack of feeling all together. You just shut down. Anxiety is similar, it's not about worrying about the test; it's about worrying about the test, then worry what your friends or aprents will say/think when you fail, then worrying that that one test might might you fail the entire course. Anxiety is when you can't stop worrying about everything, and each worry leads to more worries about the possible outcomes. Your claim is the ""vast majority"" but your anectdotal evidence is purely based on students applying for extensions. Mental health issues are resulting in more time of work in the UK than almost any other problem. Suicide is still a highest cause of death among men under 50 in the UK. Now even if we say that all of those are still the minority, surely helping the people in need of that help is worth letting a people get away with an extension on their work? The alternative is why go back to saying that mental health is a personal issue, that people just need to look at their life and figure it out. Why not let the medical professionals decide what an illness is and how to treat it and everyone else just accepts ""I've got anxiety troubles this week"" in the same way most would accept ""I've come down with a virus"".'.

"The argument: 'If one person body shames, then it's a personal/personality problem. If everyone body shames, then it's a societal problem. Look at slavery. When everyone owned slaves, I can't judge any individual for owning slaves. That's what people did at that time. It was a societal problem. But if no one owns slaves, and you are the only one, then I'd judge you pretty hard. It's a personal problem. Today, many otherwise very nice and well meaning people participate in body shaming. They don't have a personality problem in any other aspect of their life. But they still participate in body shaming. That suggests body shaming is a societal issue and not just a personal one. Note, this is changing. Fewer and fewer people are participating in body shaming. That means it's shifting from a societal problem to a personal one. But it's not quite there yet. Attitudes towards homosexuality are a good example of this process. In the 1980's, most people were homophobic. In the 1990's, things started to change. People were still homophobic, but the attitudes started to shift. ""I'm not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with it."" Then in the 2000's it shifted further. Nowadays, if someone is homophobic, it's more likely to be a personal or maybe community problem than a societal one. Body shaming is on the same trajectory.

Counselling does very little to make them feel better. So instead, we use surgery and hormone replacement therapy. It's not ideal, but it makes them feel a lot better. Unlike people with untreated anorexia, bulimia, and other serious mental disorders, they go on to live happy and productive lives. Since it works, why argue with it?

"The argument: 'So, the first point is about quantum mechanics. Inescapably, regardless of what interpretation you select for quantum mechanics, you can't avoid the fact that some randomness actually does exist. Theories of hidden variables, which are required to claim we exist in a deterministic universe, generally cannot account for everything we observe, especially when it comes to phenomenon like entanglement or quantum tunneling. Bell Inequality ------------ The Bell inequality has got to be one of the best-known examples of this. Suppose you take two photons and send them on their way in opposite directions. The polarity of these photons are entangled. This means that, if you set up a polarizing filter and send both photons through the filter, either both photons will make it through, or neither one will make it through. If you send one photon through a horizontally polarized filter, and the other through a vertically polarized filter, you are guaranteed that exactly one photon will make it through the filter. So far, so good--the predictions of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are pretty much the same. But it gets strange when you rotate one of the filters 45 degrees relative to the other. In this case, classical mechanics predicts that you'll see a 50% correlation between the two particles; quantum mechanics predicts a correlation of about 70%. Care to guess which value we observe? Quantum Tunnelling ------------- And then there's the matter of quantum tunneling. Suppose you take an electron and put it in an energy well. The electron has 7eV of energy, and the well is 8eV deep. Suppose that, if the electron were somehow moved outside of the well, without adding energy to the electron, it would still have 7eV of energy. According to classical mechanics, the electron will stay in the well indefinitely, like a steel ball rolling back and forth in a bowl with no friction. But according to quantum mechanics, the ball will escape eventually. But who cares which it is, really? ------------ But really, there's a deeper problem here.

You know that there is a chance of getting killed when you go for a drive in your car. You know that x many people are going to have a heart attack somewhere in a given day. But terrorist attacks come out of nowhere. People are just walking down the street in a city like they do everyday, but they were then unexpectedly killed. It reminds people that things they considered perfectly safe aren't as safe as they imagined. As terrorist attacks become more frequent, people are getting used to them though. 2. There are 1000 homicides in a given day, but they all occur in different locations to different people. Terrorist attacks are concentrated killings.

Many people (bigots in particular) lament terrorist attacks as a sign of the decline of Western civilization. Every time there is a terrorist attack, they think it's a sign of all the evils of people who are different from themselves. As such, it's not just the mass death that is tragic, but what it represents for their worldview. 4. The killings were intentional. It wasn't an unstoppable and surprising hurricane or earthquake. It wasn't an unpreventable disease. It was a human being purposefully choosing to kill other human beings. It's horrible because it was completely preventable with love and understanding.

"The argument: '&gt; Nationalizing these reserves would allow the US to generate vase sums of money to pay down our debt and fund state and federal programs. 1. The US already generates a ton of revenue from the leases and taxes on American oil production, but shares significantly less risk. Right now American oil companies are hurting because of the collapse in the international oil price (oil was worth twice as much two years ago as now), but the rest of the American economy is doing relatively well. &gt; In addition to generating revenue we could reduce oil and gas prices for our citizens. The problem here is that if there is extra oil, the most economically efficient thing to do is to sell it to another country. The least efficient thing to do is to keep the extra supply in the US to lower prices. Voters don't really see the long term economic benefits of free trade, but they do see that their prices at the pump go down immediately by keeping oil in the US, so it's hard for them to want to give it up even though it hurts them eventually. Furthermore, this just makes the oil price artificially lower and encourages people to waste more, which is bad for the environment. &gt; Nationalizing these reserves can also help us shift toward green energy by using the revenue to develop green energy tech and eventually reducing output without having to worry about a profit motive. I think the opposite is true. If you look at countries with nationalized oil schemes, they often prioritize their oil companies over other forms of innovation. Right now the US would profit just as much or more from a new green energy company. But if they own oil companies, they would lose significant government revenue if new green technology replaced their oil investments. This creates an incentive to make developing green energy more difficult, as Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia have done. Furthermore, it favors American companies and ideas, even if innovative foreign companies can extract more oil for less cost with less waste. Private companies have an incentive to fire as many people as possible to keep costs down. Politicians who lead government firms have an incentive to hire as many people (who become their supporters) as possible. This leads to a lot of dead weight and inefficiency.

But if you are one of the people who is hurt by free trade (your job is lost) then it's not ideal for you personally. Yes, in the long run, you could develop new skills and end up with a better quality of life, but if you are already old and looking at retirement, there isn't much time to change. Plus, people don't like to change themselves. It's a lot of work to improve one's skills and well being. It's much easier to convince politicians to adopt policies that benefit you personally than it is to roll up your sleeves and do the work yourself. I'd argue that while most Americans would be better off slightly by free trade, there's a vocal minority who would be significantly worse off, at least in the short term. If 100 Americans would get 10 extra happiness points from free trade, that means there would be 1000 happiness points. But if 10 Americans lose 100 points each, that's a 1000 point loss too. It's true that you would greatly improve the lives of the many people living in poverty in countries that would get new jobs as well, but American politicians are elected to improve the lives of Americans, not of impoverished people worldwide (unless that's what Americans want them to do). Furthermore, if you have a very comfortable hot tub and a freezing swimming pool, if you remove the barrier between them, all you get is one cold swimming pool. You didn't really improve the lives of the people in the pool, but you made everyone in the hot tub less comfortable too.

Humans really only need to live long enough to reproduce and raise their children. After that, comfortably living into retirement is just a luxury. 4. Most deaths occur at one of three points in life. Infancy/early childhood, pregnancy/birth, and old age. I don't have a problem paying for maternal and childhood care though programs like CHIP, but once we are talking about keeping old people alive for longer, it becomes less important to me. 4. There are limited resources on Earth. Every penny we spend to keep a 80 year old alive is taking away from money we could spend on more useful things. If they are rich from living a productive life where they helped others, and they want to spend it on themselves, that's up to them. But if they cost society more than they benefitted it, then why shouldn't we pay for something that would improve society in the long run? Any investments in education, infrastructure, scientific research, etc. are better for the greater good than keeping the elderly alive longer. 8.

"The argument: '* The high school graduation rate in Iowa is 88%. In Wisconsin and Vermont it's 87%. * The high school graduation rate in New Mexico is 63%, in Nevada it is 62%, and in Washington DC, it is only 59%. If there was truly equality of opportunity in the United States, it would imply that hundreds of thousands of students in those places with low graduation rates are inherently less hard working or less intelligent than interchangeable students in those in states with higher graduation rates. I find this conclusion absurd. It is far more likely that socioeconomic factors and access to quality education factors are the limiting factors for students in those low performing states. I can understand unequal outcomes in the long term (a doctor will make more money than a fast food worker,) but if there are unequal outcomes at the bare minimum level to function in society then it is unfair to say that there is equality of opportunity. You might argue that this is a regional problem, but the numbers don't support this argument. * Texas, another boarder state right next to New Mexico has an 86% graduation rate while Arizona has a 78% rate. * All of Nevada's neighbors come in at least 10 percentage points higher than it does. * All of DC's neighbors come in at least 20 percentage points higher than DC. Based on this information, I'd say that it is a reasonable conclusion that access to education and socioeconomic factors play significant roles in determining outcomes. It is unfair to say that there is equal opportunity when rates vary so much between states with similar populations.

"The argument: 'Things like schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, etc. exist in all countries, and they are perceived to be negative in all cultures. Psychiatry is taught at medical schools around the world, and many psychiatrists move to different countries to practice. If psychiatry is driven by cultural values, how do you explain Indian trained psychiatrists practicing in the US, or American trained psychiatrists practicing in sub-saharan Africa? If you are licensed as a psychiatrist in any European Union country (with at least four years of training), you are automatically licensed to practice in all EU countries. If psychiatry were dependent on culture, this would not be possible. &gt; For this reason there should be completely different psychiatries for each culture or philosophical position that would mandate different approaches and thus there should be accreditation institutions for all of these different psychiatries as opposed to having a single one that enforces the values of the leadership onto everyone. Technically, in the EU, there are 28 (soon to be 27 since Brexit) different accreditation bodies. There is one for each member country. They have the option of taking different philosophical positions, but for the most part, they all agree about which is the best one. As much as it's maligned, psychiatry is clinical medicine. It's a science and an art with best practices that apply to every country around the world. The same applies to psychiatry in countries beyond the EU. It's why psychiatric journals receive submissions from countries as diverse as Japan, South Africa, India, China, Argentina, Brazil, the US, Germany, Russia, etc. They are all contributing to the same body of literature and basing their clinical practices on that literature. Furthermore, many studies are repeated in cultures around the world before they are accepted.

You want to give them the bare minimum needed in order to survive, but if they want anything nice or luxurious they need to pay extra or work harder. What is the best food to give them? Corn is really easy to grow. You can turn it into high fructose corn syrup, which is really easy to transport and use. You can easily make into Coke and Little Debbies, which never expire or go bad. These products are high in calories and dirt cheap. On the other hand, fresh fruits and veggies are relatively expensive. They cost more to grow, they are tougher to transport, and expire relatively quickly. Sure, corn syrup is less healthy. It makes you fat and tired. It sets of a chain reaction where feeling tired means you eat convenience foods that make you too tired to cook anything with veggies, which means you eat more convenience foods. But why change it? The goal is to provide poor people with the bare minimum, remember? And why not give them stuff that will make you rich? Large corporate farms get rich off of corn, companies like Pepsi and McDonald's get rich off of using corn syrup as an ingredient, and retailers get rich selling it. The margin on convenience food is far greater than the margin on veggies. If you give someone a dollar, and they pay you a dollar back, all you lost was the cost of producing the food. And don't forget that the first dollar comes from public taxes whereas the money ends up in the private owner's hands. So if your goal is to provide the bare minimum, then the convenience foods are the way to go. It doesn't help the person who has to eat them very much, but it keeps them alive, which was the only goal. Plus, people will blame them for buying junk instead of you for selling it. As long as you don't have to pay for their healthcare, this is the way to go (once you add in the cost of paying for diabetes, heart disease, etc., it becomes way cheaper to give them healthy food in the first place.)

You don't know what the coin is, but once I show it to you, you know. The coin was unknown until it became known. But lets say I flip the coin and I look. If the coin is heads, I flip it again and show you the second result. You would see the second coin, but you would never know if it was the first result or the second. You would never know the first result. That would be an unknowable thing from your perspective. This applies to the quantum level as well.

"The argument: '&gt;because it wasn't real to begin with Sigh. Here is the thing, most beliefs consider a higher purpose than immediate cause an effect. Many of these beliefs have effects later on or in their version of the afterlife. And well, look at it this way. If you look at the Bible as an example, there was an Old Testament law not to eat Shellfish. Now while it may seem stupid to those of us in the modern era, do remember that back then they did not have our level of sanitation or understanding. You know what most Shellfish eat? Parasitic micro organisms... Now what do you think could possible go wrong with a Tribe of people who have just settled down in a new area, with no resistances or knowhow to such parasitic organisms, eating Shellfish? If that was disregarded, they might have been wiped out, especially if it somehow spread. Now let us take a look at modern society. One thing to consider is that Religious Beliefs are very **important** to those who believe them. Would you say it is a **humane** thing to make Islamic Women take off their face masks, head gear and make them feel unclean? Or is it humane to have doctors **forced** to commit what they **consider murder**? (Abortion and Euthanasia. Your opinion on these things does not matter, what matters is the opinion of the people being forced to commit these acts). I think it is very... self-centered to force your beliefs onto others in such a way and disregard their feelings and choices. It does change when their beliefs cause tremendous damage (Jihad...) but for a majority of religious beliefs? That is just not the case and they should have the right to live their lives in this way. You also cannot force people to have no religion because that is implying your superiority to them and takes away their freedom, especially when this freedom is not damaging. There are worse things we can do that are legal. If you want an example, look at smoking which literally poisons a group of people near you and yourself and causes increased chance of cancer/slow deaths. Let us take a look at the science of things.

But instead, I'll focus on the limited upside. You say: &gt; It will be for leisure use as I can easily transit to work and school. Which Mustang are you going to buy? Is it the V6 or the V8? Have you ever driven one? The basic problem with the lower power Mustangs is that while they have the stylings of a 500 horsepower muscle car, it's really just a mass market economy car dressed up as a sports car. Just to give you an idea of what I mean, the V6 Mustang was relatively cheap compared to other cars at the time. The average new car sold for $28,800 in 2007. The Mustang started at 19,995. Even with options, it was still cheaper than most cars. This is apparent in a lot of ways. The interior materials were cheaper, it didn't have the cool features present in average to higher end model cars, and the engine was weak. The 2007 V-6 Mustang went 0-60 in 6.5 seconds. The 2006 Honda Accord EX sedan went 0-60 in 5.8 seconds. The 2007 Mustang was all about styling. It looked cool. Sure the car got poor gas milage because of it's boxy shape, had little room to fit passengers, and had a small trunk, but it looked like the muscle cars of America in the 1960s. The only problem is that it didn't perform like them. Once you strip away the nostalgia and style factor, you get stuck with a slow, common, economy car.

A factory can print paintings much faster and much more accurately than any artist or forger ever could. But a factory or robot can't create an original thought (at least not yet.) Modern art is often criticized for being something that an eight year old could do. Technically, their skills are the same.

"The argument: 'While it's not *necessarily* a stable long term solution, the fact that the U.S. runs with such a huge persistent deficit demonstrates that it's possible for a government to spend money that it's not taking in in taxes.

Yes, there are long-term risks of inflation, but if the government were restricted to a very small scope, this won't actually happen if the amount of money being injected into the economy is &lt;= the growth rate of said economy.

They have a 1.3% growth rate. * The US has 134 of the largest 500 companies in the world, covering every single sector. It has a population of 319 million people. That's 2.3 million people per major company. The US has a 2.2% growth rate. * China has 103 of the largest 500 companies in the world. It has a population of 1.36 billion people. That's nearly 10 times the population of Russia, but it still has 13.2 million people per major company. It has a 7.7% growth rate. My point is that by almost any metric, Russia is not the country to make a special economic partnership with. It has very few major international corporations that can provide American jobs (compared to China, Japan, Germany, France, etc.) It has a very slow growth rate (compared to places like China and India). It has a small market for American goods (compared to China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, etc.) The US tolerates Saudi Arabia because they have absurdly cheap and plentiful oil (they can extract it at very low cost because it's all located in easily accessible wells.) This means they can influence the global price of oil, [like they did a few years/months ago.](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21711088-oil-prices-surge-saudi-arabia-and-iran-sign-deal-opecs-meeting) On the other hand, Russian oil is very expensive to extract.

"The argument: 'You seem to be equating how the characters behave on the show with how good it is. That is totally misguided. By your logic: * All Walter White had to do to support his family was stop cooking meth. * All the cast of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia needs to do to run a profitable bar is is stop horsing around and take their jobs more seriously. * All Jerry Seinfeld needed to do to find love was stop being so picky. And of course: * All the people in the Walking Dead need to do to survive the zombie apocalypse is work together and stop wasting time talking about their feelings. But this doesn't work. People on these shows act stupid because people in real life are stupid. Sure if a bunch of green berets were caught in the apocalypse, they would be much better at surviving. But these characters are just regular, stupid, fallible people caught in crazy circumstances. Just because it's the zombie apocalypse doesn't mean the slow people suddenly become fit, or the stupid people become smart. It doesn't mean that people will somehow stop arguing about stupid stuff or talking about their feelings. Jerks don't start acting nice, and nice people don't start acting like jerks.

"The argument: 'Superdelegates are an interesting phenomenon. The basic rationale is that the Democratic party should be in control of who the Democratic nominee should be. In many primaries, third party voters can vote in the Democratic primaries. That means that potentially, independents, Green party members, and many others are able to influence the Democratic party's nominating process. To hedge against this, the Democrats created the concept of a superdelegate. Party leaders now hold 20% of the votes. Generally, they vote with their states and their personal opinions don't really matter, but they still technically hold an interesting amount of power. Essentially, the Democrats struck a balance between allowing the average Democrat the most power in their vote without unnecessarily opening themselves up to influence from third party voters who are seeking to damage them. Bernie Sanders is in a unique position because he wasn't even technically a Democrat until last year. From 1979-2015, he was an independent. This brings me to your argument. You are saying that Democrats should immediately withdraw from the party. That's basically proving the superdelegate concept right. They created the entire idea to protect themselves against voters like you, who aren't real members, but join when it's convenient in order to get what they want. The real way to win this scenario is to double down in the party and stick around long enough to make lasting change. That's essentially what the Tea Party did. Instead of leaving the Republican party, they forced mainstream Republicans to do what they wanted. Now, a Tea Party candidate just won Iowa. The only other option is to dismantle the two party system. The only problem is that most people are happy with the two party system the way it is. You would have to battle the great majority of American voters to convince them otherwise. Out of these options, sticking around in the Democratic party long enough to make change is the optimal approach both in the short term and the long, if you hold the views that you do. Even Bernie Sanders decided to join the Democratic party instead of running as an independent. The concept of a registered Democrat doesn't matter. There aren't very many of them. There are a hell of a lot of people who aren't registered, but vote Democrat anyways. You are advocating that people like you switch from the former",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],36.0,True,False,Lifestyle,"Power: dominance,Power: resources,Conformity: interpersonal"

"The argument: 'Bus frequency should only be based on how many people use them. The reason people use the busses is irrelevant. If 10,000 people ride busses on Monday, and 5000 people ride busses on Tuesday, then there should be half as many busses on Tuesday. This is because busses are only cost effective if a lot of people use them. If a bus costs $100 to run and 100 people get on, it's $1 per person. If only 50 people get on, it's $2 per person. The cost is twice as much per person. The bus fares would have to increase on less popular days to balance this out. Plus, it's not like the busses aren't running at all. If someone still needs to use a bus on an unpopular day, they can still get one for the same price. It's just less convenient. The taxpayer covers this additional cost of unpopular busses for people, but it's unreasonable to ask them to bear additional costs just for convenience. Voters have decided against it. Again, this has nothing to do with church or anything else. It's only based on the economics of running a bus. You can replace church with hospital, school, or any other important thing and it would still apply. Edit: Apparently busses is the old spelling and buses is the new one.

"The argument: 'One important thing to remember for any game, but especially Zelda is the idea of Scaling. In your first dungeon, you start with only a few hearts, but most enemies will only do 1/2 to 1 heart's worth of damage to you. Dungeons are short and easy to solve with little danger to allow you to learn the game. Starting with a lower amount of hearts allows the game to not be an absolute cakewalk from the beginning, and have a level of challenge that increases steadily. You may only start with 3 hearts, but the boss of dungeon 1 will die in three hits. That's a much easier pill to swallow and a much easier concept to learn than being a brand new player and having 10 hearts, having to damage a dungeon boss 20 times to have victory like you might in dungeon 8. | As the game progresses, dungeons can become more complex with switches, and water, and special skills to reach new areas. These dungeons take significantly longer to traverse, and in order to successfully navigate them without dying more hearts would be needed! Having a variable amount of life allows the user to go out of their way to seek pieces of heart to improve their character. You can give the player a sense of victory, and ownership over their character. *edit* Oh... your edit makes your point completely different than what I expected.

If you want to complete the analogy, consider that Batman fights terrorists, is a billionaire capitalist, carries a stupid/lazy public appearance while working hard to protect citizens behind the scenes, and was villainized at the end to protect his friends. Hell, even his bat symbol even looks kinda like W. Unless you are a hardcore neocon, you have to admit that some of Batman's/Bush's approaches fall in a moral grey area.

Part of our enjoyment of the environment is the fantasy that it is untouched and majestic. Lions running wild is part of that fantasy. If they only lived in zoos, it would burst that bubble somewhat. Those charismatic animals are the poster animals that pull in money to save less charismatic animals. People are willing to donate to save pandas, and some of that money is spent on other more ecologically important species. A person might be willing to spend $10 to save a panda, but nothing to save a random, but important, insect. If $9 goes to the panda, and only $1 to the insect, that is still one more dollar going to the insect than would have otherwise happened. Forget the donation part. That only makes up a tiny percentage of spending. What matters are environmental laws, policies, and regulations. One image of an oil covered penguin motivates more voters than a bunch of dead krill. The same laws that protect popular animals will also protect other animals. Conservation is less a matter of rescuing dying species, and more about preventing humans destroying their habitats in the first place. It's kind of like NASA and rockets. Government officials wanted advanced rockets so they were willing to fund NASA. The general public wanted space exploration, so they were willing to fund military research. Those groups came together to get both. In the same way, the general public wants to save cute animals. Serious conservationists and ecologists want to save ecologically important species. Together those groups work together to lobby for protections for both groups. If we deprioritize the cute animals, we'll lose an influential support block.

A better comparison would be the anti-war non-interventionists in Nazi Germany who were opposed to Hitler starting wars. WWII was a war against Hitler, Nazi Germany, and the Axis powers as a whole. Once Hitler was killed, it ended. There was a clear end point. The war on ""terror"" is a never ending. You can always extend it by redefining what constitutes ""terror."" It's basically come to mean anyone who is Muslim is an enemy. That's how the US justified going into war with Iraq and Afghanistan despite there being very limited connection between those two countries and Al Qaeda, the specific terrorist group that attacked the US. Now it's being extended to ISIS, which largely exists because of US military intervention. Furthermore, many European countries begged the US to help during WWII. Meanwhile, no one really wants the US intervention in the region (except maybe Israel). They see the US as a threat, especially now that it's working with Russia to carve up the area.

That means that the more successful my company is, the less control I would have over it. If the company becomes worth 10 billion dollars, I would only control 1% of the company. People dilute their ownership by selling stock all the time, but they usually do it so that they have money to spend on another great idea. In the model above, we split out 900 million dollars. Instead of letting a successful entrepreneur keep the the money to start a charity or a useful company, which could generate even more money, in your model, we'd simply send 300 million Americans a stock for 3 dollars and that would be the end of it.

"The argument: '&gt; I feel like UBI has become a rallying point for alot of people who have grown up in a generation that has demonized welfare This is one of the strongest arguments for basic income. Welfare is demonized, but it is not just the current generation which has demonized it. A paper in which this in the Manitoba annual income experiment from the 1970's. It was found that many people who joined in on the experiment did so for two reasons. First, it created a sense of financial security, and second, that it was not welfare. Welfare is a stigmatized idea in which the people who need it may not use it because of the stigmatization which comes from it not being universal. The point of this is to create a fair system. If everyone receives the money, no one can be stigmatized for accepting it. As such, basic income is superior in this sense to welfare in which only those who qualify are able to benefit from it. A big problem with welfare is that it does not provide the people receiving it with the ability to use it as necessary. If you are provided with $180 in food stamps per month, but you only need $140, you are losing access to $40 per month which you could use toward other necessary expenses. You are limited in how you can use the money you receive when you are on welfare. Basic income though is just a lump sum of money which can be used for anything. This means that when your car has trouble in 10 months and is going to required $400 to fix, that $40 you saved every month in your food budget can be used to pay for it.'.

Anyway, we can establish that whoever controls the army can seek his own profit and interest, and really you find this in all societies where in some cases generals have become dictators and elsewhere democracies officially using force to protect their interest.

It was only a few decades ago that homosexuality itself was illegal in most states, let alone same-sex marriage which was unthinkable.

If it could be done then, it can be done now. I do not believe that ""Occupy Wall Street"" was particularly successful, but that hardly discredits the whole idea of protest movements. Some fail, some succeed, much like anything else.

"The argument: '&gt; I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection. &gt;I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.

There are almost no detrimental effects involved. But opiates can be horrible, hell, even prescription drugs can be abused, and our society generally wants its people to be healthy and un-addicted to narcotics, because that's a drain on funds. Not saying that the war on drugs isn't (it's a bloated waste of money and lives). To give a personal example, a girl from school was addicted to heroin after being introduced to opiates for a long time and her life suffered from it.

It doesn't really matter if the end grades are compressed into the As and Bs through a curve or if they are actually distributed into there. You want an exam where no one gets a 100 or 0, and most fall in the middle. What really matters is the student's z score (or percentile)- honestly this would be more useful to report. In terms of entering grades, if the student is doing well *enough*, there's an expectation that they will get a high grade. So- what you can do is curve so that a 90 is actually pretty bad, you can give that student feedback to bring their performance up, but the student doesn't become screwed due to a bad-looking grade.

About 50% of Californian inmates are Hispanic. I don't know the illegal percent off the top of my head but you can guess it's substantial. It costs 30-50 thousand a year to keep someone in prison. There would not need to be a big round up of illegals. Simply by crucifying a few businesses who hire illegals you could scare other places into firing their illegals. Make stiff penalties for hiring illegals and the cost/benefit stops working out. Opportunity dries up. One free plane ticket or bus ride (whichever is cheaper) home on tax payer expense. The wall could be paid for out of Mexican foreign aid. Instead of sending them a shit load of money every year we send them a shitload of money minus the cost of the wall/upkeep.

"The argument: 'When I use toilet paper, I'm often left wiping and wiping over and over until I give up. I don't have a hairy butt either, it's just the nature of TP. Sometimes I even hop in the shower to simulate a bidet and clean myself. Also, as a woman, when you bleed multiple times a day for days on end every month, toilet paper just doesn't cut it. It can't remove dried blood and it can hardly remove liquidy blood well at all. I often wet down paper towels to create DIY wet-wipes to help with this. A bidet would be preferable. Toilet paper also leaves pieces behind sometimes. Women need to wipe after going number one and sometimes the added moisture (which can happen with number twos as well) will cause the paper to break and leave bits there. It's a pain to deal with and is embarrassing if you have some sexy times and notice a piece was stuck there. Showering daily doesn't help with cleanliness throughout the day because you can still get remnants left behind on underwear (or thongs) that you couldn't wipe off and is pretty gross to see and walk around in, when it happens. I don't think the price argument is helping you. Bidets are cheaper. Price-argument-wise, they win. Trying to say you would rather pay more for quality is subjective, as many people disagree with you about what quality means. The eco-friendliness argument doesn't carry any weight either, as it seems relative to a person's location and you don't have any actual data to back up a claim.

What happens if the mother doesn't know who the father is and they can't sign this in the first 24 weeks. In two years when the father is found will he be responsible for child?

Do you think it's fair for a man to say to the women he won't pay for her kid unless she does this possibly dangerous act to her body? See, your proposal is logical, but it isn't fair. The man in your equation does not have to deal with any of the risks involved with abortion. Since it is readily available does not mean it's something that people are lining up to do to their bodies, if they don't need to. By absconding the man from any responsibility in raising the child if the women doesn't have an abortion, seems like you would be forcing her into it. Hard to say forcing a women to have an abortion is fair. You might say if she doesn't want to have an abortion, she should have the kid and give it up for adoption.

"The argument: 'You ask a different question in your title than you do in your post. My response to your title question is that while it is hypocritical for Christians to legislate morality, it isn't so simply because they may fail to live up to their morality themselves. After all, most of them actually *don't* fail to live up to their belief that they should not get gay married (since that is the example you chose), besides the fact that Christianity expects its followers will sin sometimes. What makes this legislation hypocritical is that one of Christianity's tentpoles is the concept that God has given mankind free will as a means to test them. God did not say legislation should be made for the purpose of helping you get into Heaven. God never said that he wishes for people to have their personal agency and ability to sin taken away by the government. Getting into Heaven is supposed to be a matter of personal willpower and redemption. To answer your second question: &gt; Why are religious folks allowed to ignore certain things, but do everything they can to enfore others? Who says they are? For one, you are painting with a mighty broad brush when you say ""religious folks"". Secondly, do Christians ignore lying, theft, and murder? Maybe you simply aren't noticing how many tenets they actually *do* follow, because you take those for granted. Furthermore, a lot of people hold Christians to all of the teachings in the Old Testament. In reality, most Christian theology explicitly considers the Old Testament to be superseded by the New Testament. There are some Protestant sects and fringe groups that try to hold people to task over the Old Testament, but most Christians do not. Thirdly, while gay marriage may not be a high priority in Christian theology, the reason it has attracted so much attention from Christians is because of what a high-profile social issue it has become in our time. Maybe the Bible doesn't say gay marriage is a high priority in general, but we are living in an era where gay marriage is a hot topic. Finally, the pope himself is reforming the church to take emphasis away from these ""hot topics"" and try to get back to basics.

Probably not, since it accepts your ability to make the decision.

My whole world just shattered and fell apart, and I though I tried very hard to listen and recapture my feelings through my normal music, it didn't make me feel any sort of excitement or even give me any emotion. It all just felt so... empty. It was during that period that I started listening more and more to the musicians I once scoffed at like early- ""John Frusciante "" Modest Mouse"", ""Nirvana"" and among others. I finally got it after a few months of listening that I was being elitist towards what constitutes as music. I have heard songs that are very simple or just plain wrong by technical standards that have gotten more reaction and emotion from me than songs with perfect intonation, pitch and so forth.

"The argument: 'Why Christianity isn't under attack: 1.) The constitution calls for a separation of church and state: previously this was not questioned, given that things were more in the hands of the states, and everyone was christian in the beginning. As we have become more and more modern, there is more federal pressure, given the increase in so many different cultures, to not pressure people in public programs in any way. You can still go to religious schools, but you cannot preach religion in any way in a public school. 2.) The unity the US felt was based under christianity, and this has been relaxed as of late. The taking out the ""Under God"" part of the pledge of allegiance is entirely within in rights of the constitution, and arguably should never have been put in in the first place. It was put in as an anti-communist element in 1954. Clearly the US government think that being a christian nation is important to unity. Today this has been changed, and taking out unlawful parts of national pledges, is what should be done, and not an attack on a specific group. 3.) Being a christian nation, there is a notion that unless you are a God fearing man, you cannot know right from wrong. Abolishing this insane notion is at the heart of the reduction of religion in a public sphere; you can be a moral and lawful person without a religion, as well as being just as good as the next person with a different religion. The world is becoming increasingly globalized, and the fact that we still identify based on what we believe in, is more separatist than anything. Conclusion: Separation from church and state is in the constitution; when the church was the state, there was little reason to question it. Now that we are globalized, there is no reason to identify as a single religion, and it should be removed from any and all public programs. There are muslim schools, jewish schools, and christian schools, go to them if you want to. The changes in current laws is to bring Christianity more in line with every other religion.

Transgender people basically prove that, and there is evidence that ""gender"" is something that exists biologically in the brain. *However,* it is far more complex and less black-and-white than the traditional view of the gender binary, you are right. But it is clear that gender identities are very real, whether they are constructed or not. Clearly this construction has a biological basis, and our very nature as social animals basically forces us to see things in patterns, groups and constructions. It is how we are built. The goal of gender theory and the LGBT movement is to show that nothing we make up as a society is governed by a divine being that insists things HAVE to be a certain way.

"The argument: '""My perspective"" and ""the perspective of others"" is not a binary. You mention the male gaze here: the notion that a society or an individual will adopt a ""default"" perspective on the world, which happens to be male, i.e. they will look at something through a context and a system of values that are not their own. This notion implies that the self, although it is self-sufficient and has agency, is not hermetic: it has many ties to, and is fundamentally influenced by, many things in the outside world. How you relate to the outside world is as much a fundamental part of your self as the parts that have nothing to do with external stimuli. Clothing is an example of how you perform your self to the world. It embodies your relationship with the outside world. Although ostensibly the outside world is just as much a participant in this relationship as you, because today it is you who decides how to express that relationship (as in, you choose how to dress yourself - in the past, you may have been required to wear certain items of clothing because of your sex or your class and so on), the *intent* behind your clothing belongs only to you. So, a woman who follows all the trends is nonetheless *choosing* to express herself that way. How much of that choice is autonomous is unknown - but if you align yourself with the rhetoric behind concepts like the male gaze, you find that nothing that we think is truly autonomous. Anyway, to specific criticisms: &gt; If I dressed simply ""for myself"", I would find the clothes I like the most, You don't believe that most people wear clothes they like the most? I don't know how old you are, and if you are very young, maybe in your environment people tend to follow trends, but that goes away with age. Most people dress in what they're comfortable in, whether that's khakis or 5 inch heels (comfortable doesn't just mean physically comfortable).

"The argument: 'The thing is, your assertion is very subjective. What do you mean by ""emphasis?"" Merely volume? What would be ""good enough"" in your view? 10 books on racism and 2 on sexism? Is that a comprehensive view of the issues? What do you mean by ""guilt?"" Awareness of cultural prejudices and history? Don't get me wrong, I absolutely think the books assigned in high school are idiotic. There's far too much emphasis on what grownups think kids should read/learn, rather than what would make kids interested in reading/learning. But you seem to be implying that emphasis on social issues is bad because it *might* make *certain* people uncomfortable. To be quite frank, that's sort of the point of them. It's an uncomfortable topic. No one teaches it like ""Okay boys and girls, now we're going to learn about how half of the population treated the other half of the population like second class citizens for hundreds of years! Yaaay!"" But it's still an important thing to be aware of, and that means it has to be thoroughly covered: a handful of books just doesn't cut it when we're talking about generations of inequality. &gt;The diversity of the area usually put whites in the minority and I had friends of every color and gender from the time I was in kindergarten. Racism and sexism was not part of my paradigm, nor theirs, except for the occasional kid from a broken home that had picked up slurs from a drunk parent. Not everyone grows up where you did, or had the same experiences and perspective. This is obvious in retrospect, but many people have trouble realizing at first that their own experiences and childhoods are not the norm. While you may have been sitting in class thinking ""Okay, duh,"" it might not have been as obvious to others. &gt;Educators and individuals who prescribe such a heavy emphasis on racist and sexist social issues can have the reverse and a negative effect on students.

Take myself for example. When my wealthy father dies, he will likely leave me very little, possibly even nothing. Why is that? Its because I am already buying his company, his land, his homes, etc. On top of that he has set up companies that manage much of his wealth. These companies must be managed, and legally the manager of the company must be paid an income. So all of his assets are slowly being transfered to these companies, which I will buy from him and manage, with the help of accountants and lawyers. So I will continue to make a income off of these companies long after he dies, and these would not be subject to confiscation by the government anymore than any other company that is legally bought or sold between two unrelated parties. We are already doing this with the majority of his assets. I will do the same for my kids. It would only get more extreme if the confiscation was increased beyond its current level ----- The upper-middle and middle class will not have the accountants and lawyers available to them to help set up the paperwork and contracts to legally do a similar maneauver.

Countries that embrace freedom and free markets tend to do very well (Hong Kong, US during the 1800s, Britain during their 1800's free market phase, etc), including increases in life expectancy and decreases in poverty overall, including for the very poorest of the poor. In contrast, countries that restrict free markets (rule of law excepted) do considerably more poorly (see the former USSR, or India or China before reforms for example), with poverty and preventable death being much bigger problems in the latter group of countries. Also, if you want to talk about voluntary exchanges, fairness and logical consistency demands that you must recognize ""the gun in the room"" that is present with every interaction initiated by government on those who live in the area they claim power over. Governments claim a monopoly on the use of force, and can and do do irrational, infantilizing and dehumanizing things such as locking people up for having and utilizing vegetation that they don't care for (criminalization of marijuana). There are so many laws on the books in the US that it is predicted that most people commit numerous *felonies* every year without even knowing about it, and are at the whim of government officials as to whether or not they are prosecuted or not for these ""crimes"". In contrast, lawsuits against the government seldom result in those in power being held personally accountable, with any monetary gain instead coming from such lawsuits coming out of taxation (force), or even worse passed on as debt (future taxation levied against children/the unborn).

If they weren't married, they would have to pay that tax. This is the legal argument that caused DOMA to be repealed; because a lesbian widow had to pay tax on the home she inherited from her life partner, and if they had been allowed to be married like straight couples she wouldn't have had to.

Islam didn't have that, and the classical world was far less interested in empirical investigation than in philosophical speculation about natural phenomena. Secondly, I suspect modern atheism would not be a significant possiblity except for Christianity. The line of philosophical development in Europe and the impact of specifically the Enlightenment and Modernity really created the conditions for widespread disbelief in God and religion. Thirdly, the intellectual tradition in the West depends far more on christiantiy than having developed in spite of Christianity. Take a course in history of philosophy, you will see that post the classical period there was a strong tradition of critical thinking that, yes, was part and parcel theological, but it was not suppressive as you suggest. Fourthly, I'm unconvinced that the morality most atheists subscribe to would have evolved sans-Christianity. Development and value of Education? Christian. Development of medical services? Christian.

Violence has been the best tool for solving things in human history; look at WWII--Hitler wants to take over the world, the rest of the world stopped him with the use of violence."" The thing is, this statement isn't exactly honest. First, violence (at least violence on the scale of WWII) might not have been the ideal way to stop Hitler. Greater international resolve in confronting him in the Sudetenland expansion, or embargoing Germany after certain incidents, could have gone a long way in stopping the war before it started. WWII was one of the costliest, in terms of both human lives and money, incidents in human history. Second, violence didn't exactly solve the real problem of Europe being a powder keg of political instability. WWI was plenty violent, but it's hard to argue that it actually solved anything, and really it just lead up to WWII. What actually helped bring about a lasting stability were things like trade between nations, abandoning harmful racial and nationalistic identities, and using nonviolent forms of mediation for dispute resolution. If the world killed Hitler, then didn't do anything after to change root problems, we'd probably have had a WWIII after a generation or two.'.

This would usually fall into a major issue that the person was currently having or likely to have in the near future.

Any legal opinion they put out is the legal opinion of the US government; it doesn't necessarily have to be the legal opinion of Trump or his administration, and in some cases should not be. That's why Sessions asked Yates during her hearings if she'd be capable of going against Obama, and why several Senators asked Sessions that same question, and why they both answered affirmatively: because if the DOJ has an opinion that is against the President, it's not only not their job to stick with the President, it's actually their duty to defy the President. The DOJ is also the organization that investigates the President of wrongdoing, for example; special prosecutors are under the DOJ, including the ones that prosecuted Nixon for Watergate and Clinton for Whitewater.

"The argument: '&gt;""But chemical weapons are indiscriminate"" -- So are bombs. Furthermore, this distinction falls apart if one intends to kill everyone in a city block. Whether that is done with gas or artillery is irrelevant. The result is the same. Chemical weapons are indiscriminate *and* difficult to control once triggered. If you're gassing a city block, how do you be certain that the gas won't spread over a few streets and also kill everyone over there? While explosives also cause huge collateral damage, they are at least predictable. Trained experts know if they bomb building A that buildings B and C are going to take some damage too. But if you launch a chemical attack at building A, you don't know if building B, C, or even X and Y are going to be affected down the street. You don't know if the weapon will somehow find a way into a water source, or source of soil.

"The argument: 'I'm not sure I follow. You're suggesting that the Ban Lists should amount to a popular vote, and then bemoan Wizards decision-making being based on catering to the most people to buy the most product. Wizards market research amounts to a popular vote. Standard's only bans in the last decade were JTMS &amp; Stoneforge 5 years ago. The legacy ban list is not controversial, and is largely supported by the players. Wizards is fine there. The Commander ban list is all kinds of inconsistent and a constant source of bemoaning. It's not like the unaffiliated party is doing any better here. You're really just talking the modern ban list. Modern has struggled with its ban list because (a) it's a young format where (b) new cards are being injected that (c) follow recent design philosophy that states counter spells &amp; land destruction are un-fun. As long as threats are unequivocally better than answers, modern the will periodically break because there's a new oppressively best deck. It doesn't matter if Wizards, the DCI, or you in your infinite wisdom come up with the ban list. The problem is the answer cards that do not exist, so the only option is to ban the worst offenders until there's balance. That balance is really delicate, and the process is controversial no matter who makes the calls. Legacy has no problem because Force of Will checks the glass-cannon combo decks. Glass-cannon combo decks check the brainless aggro decks. Wasteland checks greedy big-mana decks. So, as a result, most people end up playing fair decks that do lots of things - and it's fun. The only problem with it is that the Reserve List ruins accessibility and the format is warped around brainstorm (for better or worse). Modern would be just fine if FoW, Wasteland, Cabal Therapy, Vindicate, and Counterspell type cards were legal in the format. You could un-ban 2/3s of the list if you had that. '.

You make your applications for university when you are under 18 and you have for all intents and purposes made the decision to borrow when you apply. This is too young to be responsibly and fairly making the biggest investment decision of your life. 2. Student debt is unsecured as there is no physical item being transfered which means it needs to be un-bankruptable. The problem is ordinarily if you make a bad investment you just wind up your company and walk away. In this case banks don't have to restrict themselves to lending based on the return on the asset, they can lend based on the lifetime labor of the borrower (whether the asset they want helps them or not). 3. Government is in the pocket of the educational institutions doing all this. It would be very difficult for government to really step in with a regulatory approach because they are so entwined with the universities financially, politically, socially. What we need to do is allow students to bankrupt their debts away, which would basically kill their ability to borrow to finance their education, and make schools be the ones who give them credit with the security being their degree - don't pay within a few years and your degree is revoked.

"The argument: 'You seem to be talking about [the hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill), the mechanism by which people adjust to a general level of happiness or sadness throughout their lives regardless of what happens to them - this lets people who have all their basic needs keep doing things and not just atrophy because they have nothing to do, which is generally a good thing. But you're misunderstanding the concept. First, the hedonic treadmill isn't all-encompassing. People who have different amounts of their needs met at different times in their lives - a concept that can be represented well by [a heirarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) will have different levels of stress and happiness at those points in their lives, just not *tremendously* different levels. What's more, people can and do *radically* change levels of stress and satisfaction within their own lives, for many different reasons. So people's lives aren't even 'generally as hard' compared to *the rest of their own lives*. Let alone other people's! Secondly, the hedonic treadmill doesn't mean that people's lives are comparable to each other, because different people have different levels of happiness/stress as'revert' points on that treadmill. So people's lives aren't as hard as each other's even if the hedonic treadmill *was* that powerful an effect, which as previously noted, it's not. Finally, underlying your misunderstanding of the hedonic treadmill seems to be an economic argument: ""Americans (I'm assuming you're USian) are wealthy compared to the rest of the world, and they still struggle for things to be better, even though they don't *really* need for it to be better"". And that seems to be a misunderstanding on your part regarding the link between happiness and wealth.

"The argument: '&gt;Sex is defined by phenotypical biological characteristics - primarily, the presence of a penis indicates that an individual is male, and the presence of a vagina that an individual is female. The issue is, social classification of gender is largely independent of genitalia. If we can fairly confidently categorise people as'male' and 'female' without having any knowledge of their reproductive system, then perhaps genitalia are not the sole determinant of gender categories. Additionally, what about typically developed (cis) men and women who have had damage to their reproductive organs? Is a man who loses his penis in an accident no longer a man? According to your classification, he wouldn't be. What about a woman with ovarian cancer who has to have significant parts of her reproductive organs removed? The inability of your account to explain or classify outliers indicates that there's something not quite right with it. Additionally, chromosomes and reproductive organ development don't map onto each other 100% either - think of androgen insensitivity syndrome for example. How would you classify a XY individual with a vagina? Biological sex is rather complicated. &gt;they are genetic outliers and are largely irrelevant to this discussion (less than 0.1% of individuals fall into this category). Not a very good point. The discussion about transgender individuals is one about minority people, so excluding rare cases like intersex people does not seem very reasonable.

The problem of course is that the idea of masculine or feminine even exist (outside of the bedroom and even then it's all over the spectrum). &gt;I believe that men are more confined than women by gender roles, Yes, and you don't think that masculine traits being viewed more positively has something to do with that? &gt;and that if we continually approach that fact by attempting to change ""femininity"" and not ""masculinity,"" we will fail to facilitate change. This one gets me because my feminism is tied very strongly to this idea. I wouldn't be a feminist if I didn't think this way.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'I highly doubt this person wants to ""shut down all intelligent discourse and reasoned discussion just so that he or she has a captive, silenced audience for his or her emotional venting"" what she likely wants is to actually, finally be *heard*. Often, people who complain about the status quo are shot down and told they're just playing the race card, or hypersensitive, or need to relax because it's just a joke. Just look at this: &gt; When students tried to tell him about their painful personal experiences as students of color on campus, **he responded by making more arguments for free speech.** That isn't a debate, it's shutting down their point of view. Now, is she necessarily taking the best route? I don't think so, personally I would have done things much differently. I am not strictly defending her actions, I am explaining her frustration. For instance, look at the tweets in that Washington Post article, they're not intelligence discourse or debate. They're railing against someone for having and expressing those feelings. Maybe if these people felt that people were listening to them, they would feel better about debate.

"The argument: 'Everything you have said in your details is completely false. What you do not understand is that there is a media war and that stats can easily be misinterpreted to say anything you want. All of the blog reports you have read about immigrants not hurting US employment have HORRIBLE flaws in their logic. Those arguments are made lacking even a basic understanding of economics. You are truly naive to believe this kind of propaganda. Here is a rebuttal to a few of the arguments you have fallen for: Failing Pensions, SSI: Any sort of issue about the government not having money to pay for things comes from one simple source: Wealth concentration. The government prints money, the 1% scheme to get all that money back in the same accounts. Printing money devalues everyone's savings, lowers the buying power of the dollar. Half of these money printing initiatives involve dumping money in the hand of shell corporations that manage to sneak it back into billionaire hands pretty quickly, instead of putting it in the hands of the people or the government. The end result is no one can afford anything except people that were already rich. That is why college now costs a near life debt when it used to be subsidized by the government for the good of the economy. The same goes for your ""failed pensions"". Well planned inflation caused that. Wanna know something that causes mass wealth concentration? Labor/Buying power arbitrage. Make something with really cheap labor, sell it at an enormous markup, concentrate the difference in the account of an already ultra rich billionaire. Great way to suck the life out of any economy. The idea that illegal cheap labor or Hostage1b labor doesn't drive down wages is utterly ridiculous. None of those arguments even remotely consider macroeconomic effects. A huge influx of people willing to work twice the hours for half the pay will of course drive down wages, but the studies you look at only consider the compared wages between citizens and illegals at any given time. THIS IS A CIRCULAR FUCKING ARGUMENT. The wages were already driven down by the massive influx. You can't then compare the wages of the two and call it science. If those people were never there the wages would be much higher and the economy would be much healthier because of distributed instead of concentrated wealth.

Tipping is a part of restaurants, but it's never an obligation. It's just frowned upon to not tip (or to leave a poor tip). And like it or not it's the system we're currently using.

"The argument: '&gt;I completely understand those who argue that the U.S. military is no longer fighting for the direct freedom of America and American citizens, but I feel like what the military is actually doing—securing the same freedoms that Americans have for citizens of nations around the globe—is just as, if not more important than defending only American citizens. The issue I take with this is that recent track record of U.S. involvement in foreign affairs seems quite poor. I am inclined to argue that betterment of situations in the areas of hostility is not U.S.'s goal, nor is U.S. army capable of making it happen. It's easier to sell ""we are invading to improve the situation in Iraq"" than ""we are invading as result of web of strategic self interest and possibly by mistake"". If it is indeed U.S.'s goal to install democracy and peace around the world why is it that we only get involved when there's something strategically important to us? Why weren't we more heavily involved in humanitarian efforts against number of African warlords some of whom committed atrocities much like Hussein? Why did U.S. (not armed forces, but through related agencies of foreign intervention) help topple democracy in Iran in favor of monarchy? Why did U.S. back uprisings in Panama? None of these makes sense if you see U.S. armed forces as freedom fighters whos goals include bringing democracy and justice to the world. But it's not at all confusing if you take a step back and examine the situation again. U.S. military is just like any other military that seeks to benefit the nation's interest using force of arms. Humanitarian effort is valiant but tangential interest of U.S. military. But let's say that U.S. army suddenly switches gear and makes democracy and justice the primary, or even secondary goals. Is U.S. army even equipped to take on such task? A cursory Inspection of history reveals couple success stories like Japan and South Korea that rose to join the ranks of developed western style nation following U.S. military intervention. But deeper inspection reveals that those nations were already had a lot of the foundations of democracy set up.

Sure, with some work you might be able to find the *actual* source of the information being presented - but the student could have simply provided you with the source their source used. &gt; So? That's what the numerous sources on wikipedia are for. It's a perfect learning tool. You'll learn to spot good parts of wikipedia, where they provide lots of information, with sources for all of it (which should of course be taught to double check), or you learn to see information with no sources on it, so you'll know to be careful with using that information. It would be best to double check whatever it said on other websites. But your teachers/professors aren't interested in learning about how to properly use wikipedia - they're interested in having the actual source of the information you're presenting. See how one of your points here is talking about ""information with no sources on it""? Yeah, ignore those because the information that does have sources on it will refrence the source - which is the actual source of the information and the one you should include in your bibliography. Wikipedia is a good learning tool, but it is far from perfect or unbiased. So just use it to find sources instead of citing it directly. Besides, by looking into wikipedia's sources you'll probably find more information than you initially thought about the topic. Or at least will be able to pad out your bibliography a bit.'.

"The argument: 'The anger/annoyance isn't over the actors ability to act in the role. I'm sure they do just fine. The problem is that there are trans actors who aren't being given a shot to play a role they would resonate with. Let's examine your NPH example, it is (IIRC) rather rare for an openly gay man to get a straight role in Hollywood or on TV. In fact, when HIMYM I seem to recall that NPH wasn't even out yet. Because once an actor comes out they tend to get type cast as only gay characters (and certainly not as leading characters). [Here's](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/homophobia-in-hollywood-why-gay-movie-stars-still-cant-come-out-of-the-closet-8455751.html) an interesting article discussing the phenomenon. I would imagine that this difficulty extends to trans actors. How often do you think Laverne Cox is going to get a role where she plays a cis woman? Or be the leading actress in a movie? Most people getting leading actor roles are straight white men. That's why nobody has a similar issue when a non-straight man plays a straight one. I'm sure the straight white men who might have otherwise played Barney in HIMYM could just pursue one of the millions of other roles available to them. But for many minorities in acting they're forced to either play their stereotype in a bit part or not work at all. So when you have a member of the group most likely to get leading roles take on the work a minority could be doing then it only continues to drive this wedge.'.

"The argument: '&gt; Guys want to have sex, that's our biological drive. It's pretty hardwired into us. No amount of societal conditioning is ever gonna change that. Women have a biological drive to have sex too, they want to have sex. The ""social conditioning"" we're talking about here is not to change human's drives to have sex - it is to get them to think about who they have sex with. The idea is to only have sex with partners who provide clear consent. &gt; In my experience as a student, drunk girls are complete idiots. That's because alcohol has effects on the brain, and that is exactly why people who are drunk beyond a certain point clearly cannot give consent. I've been around the drunk block a few times myself, and I've also attended quite a few parties totally sober. And spoiler alert: everyone is a complete idiot when they're drunk, men are no exception. &gt; The fact that you can go to prison for around 7 years for having sex with a girl when she's drunk and then she claims rape makes picking up girls scary for me. So pick up women who aren't drunk? It's like you're upset here that society would like you to err on the side of *not raping others*, and I don't get that. &gt; Let me put this into context, if I was drunk as hell and couldn't remember if I said yes to some girl having sex with me, I would not consider that rape. That's good for you, but obviously not everyone responds to situations in the identical ways you do. It's also worth noting that you're not talking from experience here, in reality you don't know how you would act or feel if someone took advantage of you while you were drunk. You're guessing at how you might feel about it. &gt; I would just get on with my life.

Bear in mind, Trump could have just as easily declared himself a Democrat, and perhaps have won the nomination despite sharing very few of their values (as he did in many ways with the Republican nomination). The primaries are designed for people who have a preference for a party to select the person who best represents that party. There are many people who have spent untold hours building up the party over the years - doorknocking, fundraising, supporting candidates up and down the ticket, writing the party platform, creating voter databases and much more. That's what the primaries are about - who gets to use all of those resources that others have created. Yes, the system is screwed up in that a candidate cannot realistically win without the endorsement of one of the two parties, but that isn't the party's fault. I think it should be changed, but that doesn't change the fact that the primaries are not the semi-finals of a fair tournament - they are a mechanism for the party members to select their representative. Bernie had not declared that he was a Democrat until recently. He never helped the party, campaigned for down-ticket or other candidates, or acted like a Democrat.

"The argument: 'Who is makeup damaging to: the person wearing the makeup or the person observing the person wearing the makeup? You make mention that you think makeup dramatically alters a person's appearance. I disagree with you on that. For most people who do their makeup at home for daily use, it's not that drastic of a change. I would say that 99% of all makeup use is for the small changes that you have deemed acceptable. I would say that dramatic makeup is saved for special occasions, like weddings (and, yes, maybe even instagram photo shoots). As someone who doesn't wear makeup on a daily basis, I am super excited to get my makeup done for my wedding because it's a very special occasion. Think of wedding makeup like ceremonial garb akin to a special white dress. Makeup on instagram is a spectacle, a fun thing to observe like a magic trick. Almost everyone who sees a magic trick video know that it's an illusion. The same is true with makeup. Mostly, however, makeup is often seen as a societal expectation. Since you are still relatively young, I am going to assume you haven't worked in an office environment as a professional before (please correct me if that is a wrong assumption). Makeup is seen as a vital part of the business casual dress code. Just like men are supposed to wear button up shirts and ties, women are supposed to wear makeup. Sometimes, wording is ambiguous in office dress codes. Other times, makeup is explicitly mentioned (although I do work in an office environment, I also do a lot of field work and am excused from normal business casual attire). Teaching girls and young women that makeup is bad and discouraging them from wearing it can hurt them in the long run when it is time to get an office job.

"The argument: '&gt; HOWEVER. I can't find a proper argument for child adoption when it comes to gay couples (although I'd like to). To me, it seems natural that a child should be brought up with a mother and a father. This preconceived arguments stems - i guess - from an ""evolutionary"" point of view, that ""nature"" intended it to be that way. Nature doesn't intend on anything. Also, how can humans do *anything* against nature? We're natural! On a broad scale the line between natural and artificial isn't so easily determined. Especially in a case where a being is not consciously doing something (in this case being a homosexual). So, now that we can ignore what we perceive nature to ""intend"" we can move on to actual arguments for adoption. [Studies have shown that having two parents is helpful to children](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100121135904.htm), but the gender of the parents doesn't seem to be an issue.

So *even if* we can blame black people for the rise in crime, we can't really blame it for the overall decline of Detroit - or other cities. &gt; How come they aren't blamed? Because it's racist to criticize black people?

This is a real racial issue that I never ever see anyone talk about. You don't see people talk about crime in cities? It's a pretty big issue that people do want to deal with. Nobody likes crime.

Driving drunk is a crime, accidentally killing people is a crime, he did both with one action but I don't see why one of those should be discounted because of intent.

Just having a slight majority in the Senate and what will probably be a slight Republican majority in the house is not in any way a carte blanche for Clinton. Second, Senate races are for six-year terms, and ignoring the opportunity to flip a Republican seat blue is only a setback to a progressive agenda. Third, the outcry about corruption brought by opponents of HRC during the *Democratic* primary does not necessarily have any bearing on how they feel about general election politics. The best way for progressive democrats to get their agenda passed through Congress is by having more people caucusing with the Democrats, i.e having more democrats. Basically, it all boils down to a single question. Are you voting for a more progressive America or not? If you are, you want as many left-leaning politicians in power as possible. Change happens gradually, and it doesn't only happen during elections. If you want to curtail whatever you're afraid of HRC doing, then get out and make your voice heard in between elections too.

"The argument: '&gt; However, I'm not clear why everyone is now saying ""Obamacare is dead. Gay rights are dead. Civil rights are dead."" Alright, this seems to be the crux of your issue, so I'll break it down for you: Obamacare- Republicans have been trying to pass legislation to kill Obamacare since literally its inception. One of the major things stopping it was a President that wouldn't sign and the lack of a super-majority to overturn a veto. But now they have a Republican controlled House, Senate, and White House and they can pass whatever legislation they want. Gay rights are dead- Probably hyperbolic, but since the President gets to nominate Supreme Court Justices there is a very real chance that things like Gay Marriage could be rolled back. Not only that but it's unlikely that future gay rights issues (and other LGBTQ issues, don't forget trans people) brought before the court are going to fall in favor of them. There's a lot more to fight for than just marriage, like employment and housing discrimination. Civil rights are dead- We've already seen this with the stripping of the voting rights act (and oh hey, fewer people voted for Clinton than voted for Obama...wonder if those voter suppression tactics worked). But the bottom line here is that with control over the *entire Federal Government* Republicans are now able to enact almost anything they want. So no, there isn't some grand mandate. But Trump and Republicans don't need one. All they need is to be in control, and well there you have it.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'The biggest issue with your view is the idea that race is a social construct, not a strict biological classification. So far, humans have categorized humanity based on phenotypical traits and characteristics but this fails to take a lot of different factors into account. We categorize races based entirely on those phenotypical differences you've already outlined. But this has lead to a myriad of issues stemming back pretty far as to who is really white or black and how much blood of one race do they need to be one or the other? If a biracial person has a child with a white person and that child exhibits some of the traits of their black great grandparents, society is likely to see that child as black despite seeing their parents as white. Biracial people posed a pretty big issue for apartheid South Africa that they just started categorizing them as their own race. We're all a part of the human species, and the sooner we stop thinking in terms of race the sooner we'll be better off. Humans are not a genetically diverse species (chimpanzees have more genetic diversity), and among humans the majority of genetic diversity is between men and women. To make matters even more confusing, when there is genetic diversity among humans it happens just as often within the same race than without. Africans and their decendents are the most genetically diverse race on the planet. So it would be hard if you were categorizing them all into the same race when there's more diversity in their genes among themselves than some of the individuals with individuals from the white group or the Asian group. If A and B are more dissimilar than A and C, but you're putting A and B into the same category and C into a different one, that's going to muddle up your results.'.

Any more than that and their ability to provide deterriorates. Those realities help shape prosperity and drive. You really can't claim small families with few children are inherently ""Western"". Catholocism has historically outlawed all forms of birth control, yet a country like Italy, arguably the home and birthplace of catholocism, who's population is over 70% catholic, has a birth rate of 1.4 children per woman, that's well below the replacement rate. Culture in this regard is changing far more rapidly than you can really appreciate. There are just many countries that are only a few generations behind. You can probably see a similar trend in your own lineage. How many aunts and uncles do you have? How many siblings do your grandparents have? How many brothers and sisters do you have? The thing is that this trend repeats itself, over and over again, in different cultures. Economic growth presents opportunities that can only be gotten through education, and the fertility rates drop. If you look at the current [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate) you'll see that the vast majority of countries are below the 2-3 children threshold, and save a few exceptiosn, the majority of countries above 3 children are in subsaharan central africa, which is probably the least developed region in the world.'.

"The argument: 'Hello! So I might go at your argument from a different perspective than many here. Correct me if I'm wrong, but your basic argument seems to be that (libertarian) free will cannot exist with determinism, and that because determinism exists, we must invoke the supernatural to arrive at free will. As others have said, there is the possibility of indeterminism from the quantum level, which btw STILL doesn't leave any room for free will, but doesn't rely on determinism to justify that there is no libertarian free will. This is counter to the idea that 1. determinism is true and 2. determinism is needed to be true to counteract libertarian free will Also as an aside - people can irrationally believe in things - I would change the semantics of your CMV but I know that's not the true content of what you're getting at. Another aside - I wouldn't be too bothered about the argument ""changing the meaning of free will"" - this is mostly a bait and switch, what you're talking about is libertarian free will, which is not compatabilistic. My new objection is this - I'm not sure how you would invoke the supernatural to arrive at libertarian free will in the first place. In other words, I agree with you that libertarian free will doesn't exist (it's a rather crazy idea), but to me it is impossible to imagine a world in which libertarian free will *does* exist. You might imagine, for example, that the soul is what gives us free will. And yet, why is one soul more compassionate than another soul? There is no question that our souls (assuming they exist, which there is no evidence for) seem different from each other. How do we account for the fact that my soul is different than yours, and if my soul is different because I was born that way, how is it then libertarian free will?

"The argument: 'OK, let's start with definitions. ""condescending"" - ""showing that you believe you are **more intelligent or better** than other people."" http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/condescending Now, ""good for you"" is usually used from a positions of weakness, to stop somebody from boasting. It is basically a short way to say: ""Yeah, yeah, you are great - but I don't really want to hear about it."" Saying ""good for you,"" it is an admission that you are not better off than the person you are saying it to. So while, I might agree that saying ""good for you"" is ""bitter"", or ""disinterred"" in no way is it ""condescending.""

"The argument: '[Sexual abuse](https://www.counseling.org/docs/disaster-and-trauma_sexual-abuse/long-term-effects-of-childhood-sexual-abuse.pdf) of children has been documented to have detrimental long-term psychological and emotional damage to children. It very well can shape a huge portion of their psyche as they grow up. Therefore, children cannot legally consent to performing sexual acts nor, as far as I know, can their guardians give that consent on their behalf. Legalizing child pornography creates a market for more of it to be produced. It creates more problems without solving anything. If you really want to get it, you are free to find it on black markets and hide it from the law like everyone else is but the legal repercussions are partly in place to prevent people from being exploited. If you are watching child pornography you need to understand that you are engaging in an activity that exploits vulnerable people. While the images already exist, the distribution and consumption of those images perpetuate the production of more images. Think of entertainment. We have more movies that exist than any person could possibly watch in their life yet we keep making more. How does you view account for that? You're just looking at the idea of images and data on the computer but you are not considering the human aspect of it, which is where the law is mostly focused on.

There are numerous self-made rich pesrons in the U.S.; off of the top of my head I can think of tech entrepeneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, or Bill Gates. However, there are also individuals who have benefited greatly from inherited wealth, whether this be indirectly through better access to resources, or more directly such as a monetary inheritance. I note here that taxes are not solely a way to pay for government expenditures, but also a way in which to redistribute income. Here are some reasons in favor of a progressive tax system (a system in which income earned is directly proportional to taxes paid): **Point 1** The reality is that one's life trajectory is also influenced by the circumstances surrounding one's upbringing. As such the division of rich and poor can become more of a intergenerational divide. Growing up poor or middle income, one may face choices which wouldn't need to be made if one was richer. For example: * A poor person may not be able to afford housing in a neighborhood with good schooling for one's child; whereas a rich individual has a relatively unlimited selection of educational opportunities for their child. * If a poor child and have an entrepreneurial idea, the resources at your disposal maybe relatively limited compared to a richer child who has access to greater resources. * A poor child is more likely to face malnutrition than a richer child. * Furthermore, due the limited selection of neighborhoods, a poor child may grow up in an unstable neighborhood or a neighborhood more at risk for crime than a richer child, whose family has a much wider selection. * A poorer child may face more pressure to not pursue higher education economically; (1) because the cost of higher education is high, (2) because there is a high opportunity cost to not working if one's family is struggling to get by. Even given this small subset of disadvantages, we can see how even the trajectory of two children with equal potential can be shaped into drastically different outcomes. **Point 2** A poorer person may stand to benefit more greatly from a gain of $1 than a richer individual.

"The argument: 'My biggest problem here is with prisoners, though a lot of these arguments can be applied to your other groups of people. Also, I'm assuming by'medical experimentation' you're talking about a more questionable variety that is commonly not allowed, especially within your example context of war. Primarily: 1. Prisoners have a distinct lack of bargaining power vis-a-vis other parties, especially the state, so the 'consent' is skewed by an actual lack of voluntariness, and; 2. There are a lot of people in prison who shouldn't be, so they're effectively double penalized by, first, ending up in prison and, second, facing possible exploitation from their unwarranted condition via these medical tests. The groups you picked suggest you favor them out of your average person because they have a somewhat diminished quality of life. Terminally ill patients, for example, could opt-in because they're probably going to die anyway, so it may as well be for a good cause. Alternatively, they could opt-in because their treatment is cost prohibitive -- a route I'm certainly not comfortable with. I do think people should have the option of physician assisted suicide and generally end their lives in a way they deem fit, but only within a framework where the alternative to fight their disease is genuinely accessible and they'd simply prefer not to utilize it, in contrast to simply not having the option and 'opting in' for things like death or, in your example, medical experiments. As an aside, another problem with this is that a lot of people get their care paid for by the state, because they are elderly or poor and thus qualify for various programs like Medicare or Medicaid. However, they generally do not cover experimental procedures, so you would have to hammer out the details there as well. Are we going to change the statute? Do you have to be terminally ill? What if the medicine doesn't actually pertain to medical issues with terminal illness but would be beneficial nonetheless? Are we going to cover these now? How would the state sustain the costs of an influx of people who are medically needy and willing to undergo these procedures so long as the state covers them?

Children (and people in general) SHOULD feel embarrassed when they do some serious thing wrong. &gt; Children are a cognitively disabled part of society: How can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence? Many children are incredibly young (less than 3) when they start getting spanked. At this stage it's very unlikely they have the capacity to understand the full implications of whatever they did. I agree that spanking should not be applied to those who are to young. But what about spanking at a later age? 7? 8? 13?

But, spanking can be a great ""reinforcement tool."" When a reason for spanking is explained, that reason has a much higher chance to ""sink in"" if accompanied by spanking. Another great reasons why spanking is better than other forms of punishment is that spanking is fast. Punishment works best when it is administered immediately after the offence.

If we look at laissez-faire capitalism of 1700-1800 era, and the ""capitalism"" we have now, you can see that communism made huge in-roads. For, example, consider the 10 demands made by communist manifesto: http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_the_Communist_Party/2 Of those: 2) A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. Exists in most capitalist countries (tax brackets) 5) Centralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. Pretty much every country has a ""central bank,"" e.g., the Federal Reserve, form which the credit flows. 10) Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form. Child labor is illegal now. All of those things (along with things like Welfare and Social security) would be unthinkable without Communism as a political movement.

"The argument: 'After a bit of a search I found the word that I was looking for. ""Street smart"" is a [hackneyed](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hackneyed) phrase. Just about every word (or phrase) that gains popularity loses a bit of it's specificity as it's adopted by a larger group of users. I'd like to address a couple of your claims: 1) The phrases ""street smart"" and ""book smart"" are used by people who are of above-average intelligence too. I've heard a friend of mine excuse a gaffe of his because he didn't have ""street smarts."" It goes both ways. People will use these phrases to make themselves appear superior, or less inferior, no matter what the situation is. Nobody wants to feel bad and they'll use whatever they can to massage their ego. 2) /u/dasilence was correct, in my opinion, by relating ""street smart"" with worldliness. The current usage has little to do with living (or hustling) on the streets. Given that a lot of people who are living in the streets are unhappy attests to the fact that having ""street smarts,"" if defined as the ability to survive on the streets, is not a skill of tremendous value. It can be developed, just like everything else. And some people will be better at it than others. A lot of people have come to be on the streets because of poverty or financial mismanagement, which may have been prevented if they had more ""book smarts."" Worldliness seems a much better fit for how the phrase is currently used. Edit: Corrected a spelling mistake. I was sleepy when I wrote this.'.

Biologically speaking, the line from Kindergarten Cop is the test. Boys have a penis, girls have a vagina, beyond that, we get into highly subjective ideas of maleness and femaleness that quite often seem fairly stereotypical to me. For example, on test is whether or not the subject feels more comfortable in opposite sex clothes. But lots of women never actually wear dresses, and there are other cultures where even male clothing would look dress like. You could go by feelings, but again, you have the epistemology problem of defining what female feeling is like. I'm female, and I'm not sure I could define what it is to feel like a girl. How do you know what you're feeling is really feeling like a girl?

Note the the emergence of [standing desks](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/five-health-benefits-standing-desks-180950259/?no-ist). Even the Apple Watch tracks how often you stand up, and recommends [standing up and moving for at least one minute in 12 hours throughout the day](http://www.apple.com/ca/watch/health-and-fitness/). It probably takes you less than 15 seconds to go to the toilet from somewhere in your house, and 15 seconds to come back to where you were. Add the obligatory rinse from the sink after pressing the flush button, and you're back to sitting within a minute. If you pee while standing you're better off. Yaay! One other reason is that not all toilets in the world are the standard bowl toilets that you're probably used to. There are many places around the world that have [squat toilets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_toilet).

"The argument: 'I get why people are saying you should wait and see before cutting them off. Having gone through a sort of similar experience, I'd like to suggest that the better option might be to give them a chance *later*, rather immediately. Giving your parents a chance to respond is incredibly kind in theory, but in actual practice, even if they *are* going to come to their senses and regret their previous bigotry, they're probably not going to do that immediately. The first things they say are likely to be the most awful things they say, and may very well not be stuff they really mean, deep down. People respond stupidly in the heat of the moment. The first things *you* want to say probably won't be incredibly productive either. So skip all that, maybe. Instead, consider writing a letter shortly before you go (the shortest, calmest letter you can manage) to explain that you feel like they won't accept this about you, and that you need some distance. If you think you would want them in your life if they can get over this and be supportive parents, try to communicate that while being clear about the fact that your need for space is not really debatable. Then if you feel like you need a new number and to lock down your Facebook for a bit, do so. You can tip toe back into emailing them somewhere down the line if you want to, that way. Letter are, IMO, a shitty solution in a lot of situations, because they deny the other person a chance to respond. But in this case, I think you're entitled to a one-way non-ultimatum that just says what's what. Not letting them respond when they're going to be at their literal worst about the issue is a sort of kindness.

"The argument: '&gt; grammar nazis seem to take pleasure in being ""right"" I think they'd prefer that you use the word *correct* instead of ""right."" (Sorry!) ******************* Proper use of grammar helps to clarify what a person is saying. Especially on the internet where people often cannot see each other's faces and bodies the words become more important than ever. The way human beings are set up, at least biologically, is that a lot of information is received non-verbally - so through body language, tone, etc. In fact, some estimates say that interpersonal communication is dominated by non-verbal cues! That's pretty amazing to think about. Back to grammar: Better grammar, better communication. Take a look at [this example](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/serial-comma) of the oxford comma: &gt; Here’s a sentence that could mean different things with and without the final comma: Rebecca was proud of her new muffin recipes: blueberry, peanut butter and chocolate chip and coconut. &gt;&gt; Without a serial comma, you can’t be sure whether the last recipe is a combination of peanut butter and chocolate chip or a combination of chocolate chip and coconut. You can make the meaning clear in two ways: place the final comma after peanut butter or after chocolate chip, or rewrite the sentence so that there is no ambiguity. Did that help?'.

Now, statistically this does end up with most people looking for people that look like them because most places in the world are pretty racially homogenous. However, if you live in an area with high representation of multiple racial groups, it's more likely that you'll be attracted to features present within those 2, 3, or however many groups but not be attracted to members of racial groups that you didn't grow up with. What this ultimately comes down to is that the human method of identifying ""kin"" groups has basically no genetic factor and is instead reliant on experiences during childhood and adolescence.

I've known someone who had a pacemaker inserted that extended his life for over a decade. The reason I've brought up pacemakers is because batteries were a problem with the early pacemakers and doctors and engineers designed a better battery case - many of the problems have been dealt with already. This is always the case with technology, it seems too radical to be truly safe and then it is. Imagine the case where everyone has a small chip implanted inside them (optionally) that contains their medical history, allergies, special needs etc. all in one place. If there's ever an emergency the doctor would have access to a lot of useful information that could save a person's life. Yes, there is a chance for theft of information.

These sworn officers are the ones with ""general arrest powers."" The rest of the employees of law enforcement are civilians, so there's no need to include them in your ""unjust shooting"" calculations. So you'll have to make changes to those calculations. The real problem is that if civilians cannot trust the police force it makes them distrust the law enforcement agencies as a whole. That's just a bad outcome for general law and order. &gt; Wouldn't it be more rational for us to realize that we need to focus on other problems that result in thousands of times as many deaths Would you like to discuss the causes of death in the US?

"The argument: 'There are many ways in which I disagree with how you wrote this up, but in basic terms it's true that an aging population leads to a decrease in a country's prosperity, and trying to allay that with immigration only works if the immigrants mostly contribute by working. I don't know why you assume that's not happening. It's well known that most people in most western countries work in the service sector, and I don't see why you would be unable to contribute just because you are an immigrant. But imagine the problem you say exists actually exists. There are other ways to deal with it. For example: (1) Be selective in immigration policy. In fact, the Scandinavian countries are already doing this. Select people who are highly educated and would be useful, or who seem likely to want to work. This can be done because it's not just the poorest of the poor that would like to live in Sweden, for example. Sweden is a nice place, so lots of people would want to live there. (2) Offer new immigrants training. There are lots of jobs that need doing that don't require 20 years of education or whatever and there is a large amount of people to pick from to do them. I am not sure if Scandinavian countries are doing this, but probably. (3) Have family-friendly policy. The Scandinavian countries are starting to do this, too, but they can clearly do more. Make it so that people don't have to give up family to get and keep a job. Make it worth everyone's while to have kids, and people will have more of them.'.

"The argument: 'What, under your framework, would qualify as a ""solution"" to the ""crisis"" in the Middle East? Is a lasting cessation of violence sufficient, or would you also require the development of genuine goodwill between otherwise conflicting parties? Assuming that the former—sustained, non-violent coexistence—is the goal, then the history of the region negates your claim that peace negotiations ""never lead to more than a momentary cease in the firing."" Less than fifty years ago, Jordan and Egypt openly warred with Israel. And yet it is extremely unlikely that this could happen again, in part due to agreements such as the Camp David Accords (as well as closer economic ties between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors, pressure from outside parties such as the United States, and the deterring effect of Israel's military). Granted, does Israel's improved relationship with Egypt and Jordan prove that peace is achievable with other states, or non-state entities? No. But it does seem to undermine a central tenant of your arguments, namely that the region is doomed to perpetual crisis. (It's perhaps also worth noting that similar arguments were made about the supposed intractability of the conflict in Northern Ireland, a region also steeped in centuries of political and religious violence.)'.

For instance, consider volleyball - with men's superior upper body strength, the downward ""smashes"" (not sure what you call them in English) are actually much harder to save than in women's volleyball, which tends to lead to shorter matches, whereas women, who generally don't match male athletes in upper body strength, tend to be able to keep the ball rolling for a lot longer than men, and also have to rely on strategy and skill a lot more than men who can simply rely on their strength to send the ball flying too fast for the other team to save. The same goes for sports like tennis or beach volleyball. Sometimes, it's more fun to let the game get down to strategy and mind-games than just let brute strength dominate all. Plus, there are also sports that are completely free of upper-body strength requirements - sports such as Olympic diving, or gymnastics, or synchronized swimming even, tend to favour women more than men, which is why to say that men's sports are always more interesting to watch than women's sports is a bit of an overgeneralisation.'.

What are they cleaning off? Well, if their outdoor cats it could be the entrails of small animal it killed or the dirt it used to cover up it's poop. If it's an indoor cat? Some cat food remnants, maybe some kitty litter dust, but probably your stink from the last time you touched it. The lesser of two evils is clearly keeping pets outside as little as possible.

I'm guessing you're american, like I am based on your references to walmart. One thing I noticed about moving to another country is that in the US the quality of ingredients really doesn't fluctuate based on where you buy it and what brand it is. In the US, it seems that pretty much everything, regardless of the brand or location, comes from the same farm, factory, and/or distributor, and is labeled differently. This is definitely true for produce. Most of the prettiest stuff makes the supermarket, that supermarket might happen to be a Whole Foods or a WalMart but its the same stuff. The less visually appealing or defective stuff goes to big food companies that make canned goods, quick meals, and processed foods. Anyway, where I live, you go to the farmers market, and you pay different prices for different vegetables and fruits depending on their condition and how fresh they are. Those overripe mushy avocados that you might salvage half of the innards are gonna go for $1 a kilo, while the ones that can be eaten today will be going for $2, and the ones that can be held for a few days will go for $3-4. Ever had an overripe, browning avocado? They can be rancid and really ruin the dish.

You mention that these people only need to change their thinking. But it seems like the people you have talked to are aware of this fact, but still struggle to actually do it. The problem with changing your thinking is that it is kind of a circular concept. If you know you need to change hoe you think, but yet your thinking has still not changed, what is there really left to do? One thing that you could do is consult an expert who is trained to help people change your thinking. This type of thing (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) is a pretty common recommended treatment for people with things such as depression and anxiety. If you can't manage to change your thinking on your own, doesn't it make sense to seek out some who can help you, such as doctor or a therapist? As for the issue of enabling, I don't think the psychiatric profession is perfect, but most medical professionals try pretty hard to base their practices on solid research. Many treatments that are recommended for theses things are backed up my multiple well-conducted randomized controlled trials. If the current state of the science is that these treatments are effective, according to people who are trained to evaluate these things, I think its worthwhile to at least give these ideas a shot.

"The argument: 'OK, so I actually agree with you in the context of a state like North Korea, where there's no real contact between tourists and real people, and trips are basically tourists showing up, seeing a propaganda presentation, and then going home (to do a dumb AMA on reddit about going to North Korea, usually). But as someone who lived in China for years, I think you're dead wrong about that, and other countries like it where you can travel anywhere (more or less) and talk to anyone. Tourism and interaction with foreigners is good; it allows people to interact and exchange ideas with people from other countries and cultures. And of course, it also helps support the lives of many locals who might be stuck working on farms or in factories if there was no tourist trade. I'm also not sure how supporting the tourist economy perpetuates the legitimacy of China's regime any more than (for example) buying an iPhone (made in China) or virtually any item of clothing. Either way, you're contributing to the Chinese economy. I'd be willing to bet that your home right now is full of hundreds of purchases that put money into the Chinese economy. That's fine, though, because is destabilizing/destroying the economy really the way you want to remove these regimes anyway? I don't love China's government either, but plunging 1.6 billion people into poverty *again* in the hopes that this time they'll come out of it democratic seems needlessly cruel (and of course that's ignoring the fact that the economy is globalized and hurting China's economy hurts our own anyway). If you want to encourage political changes in China there are better ways to do it than economic destruction, and far more direct ways to do it than *not* traveling there. In fact, I would argue that anyone who has traveled there, has spoken with locals, and has maybe changed a mind or two on some political topics, has done more to fight authoritarianism than you have by avoiding travel there.'.

Ahmed had had no dealings with the police before so it's pretty clear this is because of his race. B) The school never actually thought it was a bomb, or they would have evacuated the school, not stuck it in a desk and waited till the end of the day. They thought it was a bomb hoax. However, considering Ahmed didn't willingly shows anyone except his engineering teacher and told everyone it was a clock, there was really no reason to believe he wanted people to think it was a bomb. I suspect the reason his teacher thought Ahmed was doing a bomb hoax was at least partially related to his race, because under these circumstances most teachers would not suspect most 14 year olds were trying to create a bomb hoax.'.

"The argument: 'Context: I'm a staffer on a music blog which has traditionally been pretty metal-centric, and I don't generally listen to metal. I think that when people talk about ""I can't understand what they're saying,"" that's usually not all they're objecting to. You bring up some points like that, and there are more: Ariana Grande is generally unintelligible, most Sean Paul listeners don't understand Jamaican Patois, non-Spanish-speakers can still get down to reggaeton. I think what makes metal different is that it's often an abrasive genre. Obviously, that's not all of it - symphonic, progressive, whatever else - but a lot of people's exposure is through tech death and grindcore that they occasionally hear when their friends are making fun of ""cookie monster music."" I know very few people who complain about Death or Carnivore because they can't understand what the singers are saying - I hear them complain because they're not used to thrash. Look at it this way: if you'd never listened to hip-hop before, and somebody showed you Danny Brown's newest album, you'd probably be turned off by its power. You might struggle for things to concretely latch on to as to why you dislike it, and you might pick his voice as a major factor. That might be true, but it's certainly not all of it. Basically, people who complain about metal are usually just using the lyrics as a crutch because they might not have the musical language to describe what is so viscerally off-putting about it. Often it's hard to put gut reactions into words, and I think that if anybody complains because of the lyrics (or lack thereof), they're probably complaining about something more - the way they're delivered, the instrumental backing, the like.

It's something else entirely to treat such idle speculation as positive evidence for a squishy, ill-defined *psychological* feature whose real existence can't otherwise be established. To illustrate the problem, let's look at how trivially easy it is to come up with a story explaining why women actually have a *finer* sense of ""honor"" than men do: If there is selective pressure on men to behave honorably toward one another, it must be a secondary effect of the more primary selective pressure on women to be competent judges of honorable behavior in the first place. After all, natural selection only operates on traits that are relevant to a creature's reproductive viability. A man's ability to conform to a given code of conduct only increases his reproductive fitness to the extent that it makes him more attractive in the eyes of his prospective mates.

"The argument: 'Which Grande Armee versus which Army of the Potomac? The French Republic/Empire was at near continuous warfare from 1792 to 1815. That's 23 years experience against a large variety of foreign armies with different tactics, arms and over a wider variety of terrain versus a 5 year old army fighting the same single enemy back and forth over the same terrain. If the Army of the Potomac was forced to fight the Confederates, the Canadians, the Mexicans and the British from 1860 to 1883, they would be a formidable foe. It's your assertion that discipline and leadership would win over technology. Given equal time, what evidence do you have that Le Grande Armee of 1815 would be considerably more disciplined or better lead than the Army of Potomac 1883? I think compelling evidence could be found in the Civil War itself where the Confederates were better lead with a larger portion of West Point grads and experienced Mexican War officers, not to mentioned a very large lead in cavalry officers (Napoleans use of cavalry being a point you make). Better generalship, better cavalry and better morale and purpose amongst the line troops and Lee could still only get to the point where Armistead was shot down at the breech in the wall on the third day of Gettysburg. Hell, even Sickels showed the lack of command discipline you speak of by moving his corp out from the left flank of Meade's army and Lee still lost. '.

Ultimately, you can only end up applying force to a brain, to a human body, and that's the end result of censorship we see in every dictatorship from East Germany to North Korea. The solution to bad ideas is exactly opposite to censorship and ""caesaropapism"" - complete laissez faire freedom for people to transmit any speech/idea they wish and allowing the light of day (reason, open discourse) to be the disinfectant. It's no different to prohibition of products/services in the economic realm - you ban something and you *cause* a black market *and* it's associated thuggery and lies. You remove those prohibitions and you create *better people* (e.g. the buyers and sellers in Colorado's marijuana market). If you view memes/ideas as an evolutionary tree, then their natural death occurs eventually when their implementation does not survive reality. (An anti-vaxxer whose child dies from a disease won't make the same mistake for the second time).

But still, take this with a grain of salt. The word that your translation is translating as ""pure"" would be better translated as ""tested"", implying that you can, in a sense, test anything that claims to be divinely inspired scripture to see if it is or not. I'm not going to get into what that testing is because there isn't a definitive answer (That's why Catholics have their cannon which is different to the Protestant Cannon, which is different from the Orthodox Cannon). But the point is that if something passes the test, it is scripture, and if it is scripture there is no problem with it being included. Proverbs 30:6 is a clear reference back to Deuteronomy 4:2 ""You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you."" In this passage Moses is relaying messages from God to the Israelites. Notice how the commandment is ""do not add or take away from it"". God here is not stating that you should never state your opinion or refrain from discussion because doing so would not be adding or taking away from scripture. You would only be adding or taking away if you were claiming that your opinion was divinely inspired, or claiming that your edited version of a verse was divinely inspired on the same level as the Bible. You probably noticed that I always used the phrase ""divinely inspired"" instead of something along the lines of ""the word of God."" as it is never claimed that scripture is a direct copy of God's words, but that God instead inspired the authors of scripture to use their own words to convey his message(As opposed to the Quoran, which is believed by musilms to be God's own words that Muhammad purely wrote down).

As such, the argument he makes is one that centers around real world applications and results, not an an abstract right to free speech consequences be damned. Mill makes three core points about why the silencing of an opinion with which one disagrees is a bad idea. * **You don't know whether the idea you hold up as true could be wrong.** We aren't infallible. It is very, very, very unlikely this is true of the people on subs like coontown. But is it totally impossible? No. * **Even if the ideas on the other side are wrong, they may contain an element of truth.** I think this is where the comparison to something like climate change is apt. The fact of vocal criticism has, on several occasions, pointed out meaningful flaws in climate science that might not otherwise have come to light. Moreover, even if the central premises of climate change existing, being caused by CO2 and human emissions thereof are not in material dispute, that is not the end of the question. There is legitimate uncertainty over the magnitude of change in temperature in respect to CO2 concentration, which is a big question in respect to the degree of justified human response. * **Even if the ideas of the other side are *completely* wrong, contesting them has value.** If something becomes received wisdom that can't ever be debated or challenged, in many cases it will be poorly understood by those advocating for it. We see this in respect to many popular political dogmas today, where people will profess to support free speech, and then support all sorts of censorship.

This is a bad idea for a few reasons: * It does not take a lot of ""bigness"" to be catastrophic. The catastrophe comes from owing a lot of people a lot more money than you can reasonably be expected to pay back. And even a not-huge institution like AIG was able to fall into that trap. They sold enormous quantities of insurance against defaults they thought were unlikely and uncorrelated. When those defaults turned out to be both likely and correlated, AIG suddenly was on the hook for vast sums of money that they couldn't pay, and thereby posed a systemic risk, even though they were only one of many insurance companies before the crisis. * A small number of banks are easier to regulate.

This doesn't matter nearly as much as you'd think, especially since it's not like a new concrete company can't be founded.

As long as South Carolina wants to peaceably remain part of the United States it should not fly the flag that stems from the time they seceded and started a war rather than be governed by a President who was duly elected, but whom they disliked. * **Slavery:** As you say, the war was about South Carolina and other southern states keeping slavery against the perceived threat of the Lincoln administration. As long as South Carolina does not want to reinstate slavery, it should not fly a flag that symbolizes that. * **Racism:** Since the war, the flag has largely been the provenance of racists intent on subjugating black people. It was not widely used until the Civil Rights Movement picked up steam in the 1950s. And during that revival, it was the symbol of those who opposed racial equality. [See here](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/why-is-the-flag-still-there/396431/) for a history of the flag's revival.

"The argument: '&gt;Education is an investment in the goodwill and future of the nation/planet/humanity and should be not made to profit off. Education is a service provided to the people being educated. It gives them new skills, knowledge, experiences, and connections. It has beneficial effects on others as well, but the large majority of the benefit goes to the specific people who were educated. &gt;If education is not the primary objective of an educational institute, the institute may very well jeopardize it in hopes of making more money. How is this different from other businesses? The primary objective of a farmer is to make money, which they do by selling food they grow. A school can do the same. Indeed, if they want to make money long term, they're better off generally providing good education. Unless there's something else in play. &gt;Furthermore, tuition is usually higher, as compared to non-for-profit universities, making it harder for people of lower socioeconomic statuses to attend it. Now we're getting to the nitty gritty of why most private for-profit colleges in the US are terrible. And they are terrible. For profit colleges exist because the US government will give large amounts of money to any US citizen with a pulse for college. The tuition they charge is generally exactly enough to maximize the aid a poor person can get from the government (loans+grants). They exist to milk off the government, and their students are basically just a means to the end of exploiting government programs.

"The argument: 'You need to clarify what you mean when you say it ""should be allowed."" There are two possible veins to it, and its not clear which you mean: * **Should it be allowed legally?** Yes, clearly. Free speech protection in the US is incredibly robust. You can say far worse things than are said in *Book of Mormon* and be free from any legal reprecussions. See, for instance, [*Snyder v. Phelps*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2981429692939250360), which held that Fred Phelps and his crazy church could not be held liable for picketing funerals of soldiers with signs saying things such as: &gt;""God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,"" ""America is Doomed,"" ""Don't Pray for the USA,"" ""Thank God for IEDs,"" ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers,"" ""Pope in Hell,"" ""Priests Rape Boys,"" ""God Hates Fags,"" ""You're Going to Hell,"" and ""God Hates You."" If that's allowed, Book of Mormon is definitely OK. * **Should it be socially acceptable?** This really depends on the power dynamics of society. So all the stuff that Phelps said above is legally OK, but basically totally socially unacceptable in the US. Nobody likes the Westboro Baptist Church, and they're subject to derision and scorn. In general, I think that such derision should be reserved for people who are (in this context) attacking a religion or culture who are marginalized and unable to defend themselves. In the case of Mormonism in the US today, I don't think that's the case. Mormons are not subject to legal repression, and Mormons are able to hold positions of substantial power. Indeed, especially in Utah, there is probably more concern of Mormon oppression of non-Mormons than the reverse. Of course, dumb attacks on Mormonism should subject you to scorn for being dumb.

The founders in 1787 did not think we would develop a party system, but rather thought that the principal interest groups would be states or regions of states. Their belief was that being a Virginian or a New Yorker would be the most important part of a politician's identity. They were mistaken. The overwhelming determinant of political behavior is party, not state of origin. If New York and Virginia each have one Democratic party senator, and one Republican party senator, the D-NY and D-VA senators would vote nearly in lockstep, as would the R-NY and R-VA senators, with the D-NY and R-NY senators almost constantly opposing one another. If you want senators to be true delegates of the states, as opposed to just politicians chosen by parties, you would need to have them be selected *and removed* by state governments. By being continually accountable to the state (as opposed to serving a 6 year term) they would act as a genuine representative of that state's government. They're still likely to be partisan (because states have the same parties as the feds do) but they would actually be instruments of state government.

Trump did not levy war against the United States. He did not take up arms and start shooting US soldiers. Trump did not adhere to a wartime enemy of the United States. He did not knowingly give a wartime enemy of the United States material aid in the prosecution of a war against the United States.

Almost all crimes, and all severe crimes, include an element of ""mens rea"" or guilty mind. That means, it's not just about what you do, but about your mental state when doing it. So the simple fact pattern of ""A shoots B and B dies."" does not tell me if any crime has been committed. I need to look at the mental state of A. If A was engaged in a lawful activity (say, deer hunting) and took reasonable care (looking for bystanders) before firing a shot, and B happened to be hiding under brush or otherwise not visible we'd call A shooting B a tragic accident, but not a crime at all. If A was being negligent and not taking good care (e.g. fiddling with A's gun), we might call A's actions a negligent homicide. If A was being reckless and knowingly engaging in highly dangerous activities (e.g. shooting randomly downrange), we might call A's actions manslaughter. If A was intending to kill B by aiming for B when shooting, we'd call A's actions murder.

At that point it would become a weird Zen-Koan level of question and I'm honestly not sure how to answer that stuff. Is a person trans, if that person doesn't even know they had a different sex at any point? With that technology you could potentially swap sexes several times, what happens then? If a male-female-male person started male and ends up as male, is that still trans? Does that even make sense anymore? Honestly, I'm pretty sure most people would not be happy even about a male-female-male trans person, who is perfectly male and has no memory of being female at some point.

"The argument: 'Oh, alternate history is fun. So I think the big question is what happens between Lenin and Hitler. For purposes of argument, let's say that Lenin being in power doesn't materially change the factors in Germany leading to the rise of Hitler. So does the beginning of world war two go in the same fashion as it would have with Stalin around? I say probably. I doubt the USSR under Lenin would have occupied Poland by that time, but maybe they could have. A more aggressively expansive USSR might have caused Hitler to go after Poland sooner, especially if Lenin went after it first. If Lenin went for Poland first, and then Hitler followed in, my guess is that the allied powers stay out of the fight. Would Hitler win a straight up war in 1936 with the USSR? I don't know. He certainly might though. And maybe oust Lenin. And then he might not have been deposed for a long time. Which would of course involve more war and genocide.

If someone earns an income of $15,000 a year and is supporting two children, the government views that person as being unable to support themselves on their income (they're below the poverty line). Thus, the government will give them money (welfare) or in kind transfers (food stamps, WIC benefits, subsidized housing, etc.) so that their family is not destitute. Since that family is receiving aid from the government because they're too poor, it is nonsensical to turn around and then demand income tax from them.

Then when people speed while driving safely, they can get ticketed.

"The argument: 'The reason not to raise the minimum wage is not inflation, and it's not entitlement, it's unemployment. The problem of raising the minimum wage is that it may cause some people to get fired. There's a few mechanisms by which this can happen: * **Business failure.** Businesses are started and close every day, but not necessarily in tandem. If you raise the cost of doing business, you're likely to raise the number of closures and lower the number of openings. * **Substitution of capital for labor.** For businesses not on the verge of failure, they can still choose to substitute capital (such as equipment) for labor. You'll see this most obviously with things like self checkout at grocery stores, but there's lots of dimensions on which it can happen. * **Discontinuing certain jobs.** Stereotypically this would include things like baggers at grocery stores, who help speed up the line but whose wages can't be justified if the min wage is too high. There become jobs that just don't happen, or don't happen as much, because it's not worth paying the new higher wage. All of those things mean fewer people employed at the low wage end of the spectrum. And that's bad, it means useful work isn't getting done, and we're all a bit poorer for it, with the brunt hitting those who can least afford it. If you go too far, you can end up in a situation where getting a job at the low end of the labor force becomes more like a lottery, with lots of people going after a small number of openings, even in good economic times. France is facing this sort of a situation now, where you have a really nasty persistent unemployment situation because a number of regulations (not just minimum wages, but also maximum hours, and difficulty of termination) result in an extreme hesitancy to hire people, and huge numbers of job seekers per opening.'.

"The argument: 'If you look at at cities from a sped-up zoomed-out god-like perspective, it looks very ""organic like"" - sucking in energy, growing, moving, shriveling, respiring and producing waste... The problem with a descriptive list of characteristics versus a definition is that it's all about ticking boxes about what *appears* to be exhibited *to us*, rather than trying to determine which single characteristic is the essential one that matters. So yes, a computer and a city appear to resemble a living thing - but it's fishy. For example, we can imagine, in theory, alien life forms that break each particular descriptive point, yet we would immediately identify them as being alive E.g. one that does not reproduce - reproduction, afteral, is merely how some life systems solve the problem of change/adaption, but there could be other solutions such as adapting/changing/growing yourself without children. Or one that does not have self contained metabolic processes in the traditional chemical sense, but has information about itself strewn around it's environment, shared/accessed/modified when required. A definition, however, allows you to include and exclude members, because it designates the essential characteristic that a non member lacks. For example: ""A living thing is a pattern that contains information about itself that allows it to act/change to pursue values and evade harm so that it's existence may persist existing"". Such a definition would exclude dead things that can't act to continue their existence, such as rocks. And it allows us to include certain computer actions as life-like. But you have to decide whether it's an isolated incident more similar to an avalanche of carefully placed rocks on an inertial trajectory - or whether the robot/computer/program would continue to exist by virtue of it's own actions. But being classified as a living thing is a long *long* way away from being classified as ""alive"" in the sense that an animal with a brain is alive.

"The argument: 'Have you read The Count of Monte Cristo? There's a context in which violent retribution redeems the person carrying out the violence (even if the Count took it too far). Here is another example: a wife is beaten by her husband on and off for 20 years, and it's not just her body that has gotten pummelled, but her sense of pride and individuality and independence - she becomes his slave in all things. She feels less than human. But one night, the remaining spark of independence grows into a small fire in her mind and she thinks up a horrible death for her husband, one where he awakes tied to the bedpost, and she's explaining to him the horror of what he's done, and he understands it fully, and he's screaming - in pain and in fear - for forgiveness. He's asleep. She has a needle of sedative. Perhaps there is a baby whimpering in a cot in the next room, but that's beside the point. If it was *just* an act of self-defence - then sedating the man and fleeing would be enough. But it's not enough - she wants the thousand times she backed away in fear to be reversed, to be made up for. She has a *right* to get back the power over herself that he took away. She needs to know that she is in control over him, that she won on his terms - or the rest of her life will a haunted misery anyway. His pain will pay for her own, wiping away in part the shame for her cowardice. She'll at least have pride in making him suffer!

"The argument: 'I don't accept your premise of ""If ALL circumstances are truly identical...the effect/result is the same"" - as the test of determinism or free-will. Yes, if all is identical in the two scenarios, the same effect/result happens. **So what.** The question of Free-will is *what is the cause* of that effect/result? So to disprove free-will, *you* need to prove what the cause of our decisions are. If you can prove that all your choices are predetermined by *not you* - only then you will have disproved free-will. So what is your definition of cause and effect that allows you to disprove free-will? ------------------- To me it makes sense that what we experience *as ostensibly a fact* (that we **do** have an ability to choose) takes primacy over hypotheticals (such as how free it is, in what way, whether this or that philosophy of determinism supports or contradicts it's existence). In the first instance, first hand evidence and experience - the ""given facts"" should take precedence; we know they exist in so far as much as that is what we experience. We may not know how, or in what manner they exist, just that they do. Even logical arguments must take a second seat, because their conclusions are not infallible. But *that* we experience something that feels like this or that, are the inescapable facts that can't be denied. If you want to prove that what we experience as free will is illusion your logic has to be *tight*. Show me a single case where one of your predeterminate causes - other than your reasoning ability - *must inexorably result in a specific choice*.

Obviously, for the inmate, book smarts could get you beat up and street smarts was the key to survival.

"The argument: 'We don't *just* see the world through our eyes, however, we see it through our other sensors and our brain too. And just because our eyes may be colourblind or receive partial information, it doesn't mean the end results - our beliefs about the world - are incorrect! Corrupt input does not necessitate corrupt output. Our ability to make abstractions *does* allow us to see the world as it really is (not *all* of it at every level at a time, that would be omniscient, but the part we are perceiving). That's why a completely blind person, a chinese person and an english person all have the same abstract *idea* of what a ""table"" *is*. It's only the concrete table they choose to imagine/perceive that differs - but the conceptual identity is the same. All three persons *abstract* the idea of table *from* concrete examples they have experienced - which means they discard the non essential concrete details they have experienced to create a concept of *no particular* height/length/colour/thickness, to create an abstract concept that is the same for all three people *despite* all their concrete experiences being different. And when any of these 3 people are given a new table they have *never specifically experienced before* (e.g. a flat surface 7ft off the ground made of polka dot glass with three legs) - they all agree this is a table ""of some sort"". So Schopenhauer is wrong. The power of abstraction frees us from seeing the world as merely what our sensors tell us. The inability to do this is the state of (non-human) animals. '.

This also implies that our brains are *assigning* qualia to *otherwise quality-less* incoming data, painting (and erasing!) a picture *in real-time* within our brains from some internal qualia-pallett inside our heads. Consider how astoundingly remarkable (or ridiculous, as I believe!) that is: as you drive at 100 miles an hour through the country, what you see is being painted/erased at every fluctuation and change. Why should incoming information be considered as without a quality before reception? It has no quality to you *yet*, sure. But it still has a unique identity, fixed properties. Now what is a more elegant solution here; has evolution created qualia so that we may feel the difference of incoming data (which is silly because if the brain already knows the difference between incoming data based on wavelength differences etc, there is no need to assign it further differentiation such as with a specific quality - that's doubling the effort) - or does evolution *discover* (with ever approaching fidelity) the quality of things that already exist?

There are obstacles, but he knows he has to run a more or less straight line to have any chance of making it in 60 seconds.

"The argument: 'Yeah, we know very little about our brains but there are a lot of stuff we do know. We know that serotonin is under the healthy limit in depressed individuals. We know that antidepressants command the brain to make more serotonin, therefore helping depressed individuals. Also, when stating stuff like this you should probably used an unbiased source, larger than the small portion of people you know take antidepressants. [This study here](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2011/antidepressants-a-complicated-picture.shtml) states that when people with *mild* depression were given antidepressants and placebo, both groups got better equally. But when moderate to severe depressed people were tested, the group given the antidepressants improved much better than the placebo group. So yes, they help. As for your comment regarding overprescribing antidepressants, this is due to not only the increased number of depressed individuals in American society but also people who take drugs recreationally. Seriously, our diagnostic system is seriously flawed; you basically circle some numbers and they call you depressed. Pretty much anyone can get their hands on antidepressants.'.

"The argument: 'An action is sufficiently an ""altruistic one"" when a person, with two more values to choose from, *gives up* the higher/greater value *because* it is the greater value, and/or selects the *lesser* value *because* it is the lesser value - so that they personally feel they are benefitting *less than they could have been*. If it were possible for a fully altruistic person to choose to go to hell so that another could take their place and go to heaven, they would. Naturally this is nuts and psychologically and just logically suspect - because the ultimate act of selflessness is simply to give up all pretense and fall dead, and not move and not think and not feel. Only then you've renounced the self in its entirety. But ultimately our judgment needs to be an objective one - we can't guess or know the layers of psychological delusion in another person, and it doesn't matter what they think or what their subconscious is thinking. Instead, you judge the real values that the person actually chose or gave up. And you decide which value is objectively greater for a human qua being a human. Then it becomes simple. $10,000 vs $100. Teddy Bear for their own kid vs Teddy Bear to a charity that gives out toys to African kids. Go to the job interview vs. take a hit of heroin.

"The argument: 'Surely it is impossible for an ethical system to be purely about the ends or purely about the means. Both have to matter, because every end is proceeded by steps which can be described equally well as either a series of ""smaller ends"" or ""means"". Can a ""means"" even exist in isolation of an end? Perhaps the whole contrast between systems being either one or the other is a furphy. E.g. Buddhism vs Pragmatism. Buddhism advocates following principles, but enlightenment and the value of practicing those virtues are ""ends"". And Pragmatism can be seen as caring about means, if the ""final end/goal"" is broken up into smaller ends/goals. If adherence of some principle is a moral imperative, then it's end is it's standard of morality. ""Eating three apples a day"" is not an ethical system unless the standard, or ends, it advocates is some moral standard e.g. for your own good, your health etc.'.

"The argument: 'Hi Mods of this fantastic sub! I'm sure you've already discussed this problem, so probably ""here we go again"". One of my posts was best'of'd leading to my delta count going from around 7-9 to 37 or so overnight, without continued conversation. Feels dirty, and not fair to others. (And worse, it was just a trivial reply to a trivial CMV...about *toilet paper*!) Prior to the delta explosion, each delta represented, for me, an ""effective mind-changing argument"". I know that it's meant to measure the number of minds changed, but so long as each delta is hard won *one at a time*, it's also a stand-in measure of the number of mind-changing arguments you've posted. My 7 deltas meant at least 7 of my *arguments/contributions* had affected people. That was the pertinent point because what I had put effort into wasn't the number of *minds* I'd changed, but the number of *arguments* I'd made that changed minds. That's a nice thing to know about yourself and others. You could respect such a leaderboard for that. Because what do we really want to measure - what individuals have actually done or what they've been awarded? And who/what are we searching for, changed minds or *arguments and answers* proven to have changed minds? I don't really have a solution - I'm happy to have my toilet paper deltas removed, if that doesn't cause you other problems.

"The argument: '(Edit: I see you wrote ""aging sucks, not death sucks"". No matter, I'll leave this here anyway!) **Why do we die?** I think it's to make way for the new. The new are different. An improvement, a fresh and more vigorous start. It's not just our body that ages, but for the vast majority of us our thought patterns, beliefs and values become fixed and calcified too, like a needle trapped in the deepened grooves of an old record player. To survive, life needs to change. And to keep on changing and adapting to keep up with changes in the environment. Sex provides the changes. New life is a blank and slightly modified slate, ready for a fresh imprinting from the present. Older lives have already been imprinted by the past, by that which exists no more. No doubt we inherited death as our destiny from the very beginning of evolution. Modified offspring better survived than their parent. But if the parents were *better* at surviving than their children, then they would be the last in their line, to be picked off one by one by misfortune and accident rather than pre-programmed death. And that was the end of their lineage. Parents without pre-programmed death would eventually compete with their children or children's children down the line - if they won, their lineage would die out, there would be no more change, and they would eventually lose. So evolution invented pre-programmed death, a death from ""natural"" causes, or from ""within"" the living creature, giving it an allotted time that allowed it to persist. A balance that wasn't so long so as to endanger it's progeny, and no so short as to risk not having progeny. To ensure the right amount of change would persist over time. Death was a solution to the problem of ensuring Life would persist. It does seem that humans have the potential to circumvent this evolved law. But to merely persist, to merely keep existing is not enough for life to survive or to be worth living. We would need also to solve the problem of how to look at things from a fresh perspective at the age of 100, to be a blank slate again.

"The argument: 'I think it's a real shame that you think that ""using any form of genitalia as an insult goes against proper treatment of both genders"" merits political disqualification. The freedom to offend (as Rowan Atkinson fought for in the UK) is a more important value to fight for than freedom from offence, especially in the political arena. Otherwise no truth can be spoken to power, and society lives in fear. If ""freedom from offence"" were to become an American value - and it seems that's the way the USA is heading - then where is the end of it? Social values become Political ones. Since there is no end to the diversity of offence people can take, all manner of arbitrary speech can be considered a hate crime - and worm it's way into law - and the first amendment is betrayed by a thousand cuts. A word like Pussy, like Cunt or Cock (or Nigger) etc - is only as degrading to you (or anyone) personally as you let it be. You can't second guess the offence other's may (or may not) feel about it. We *should* hope, we should desire that people are robust, adult and rational enough to handle it, to judge it's use contextually and by intent of the speaker. I get that using ""pussy"" can be seen to promulgate a myth/lie of female weakness/cowardice, as ""cock"" the myth/lie of male selfishness/bastardry. But I don't believe in those myths - they're ridiculous - and no one should. The primary evolved/modern definition of those words are coward and jerk respectively. The ideal isn't getting rid of certain words from society, the ideal is everyone being rational enough to know the older generalisation/myth is not the meaning.

"The argument: 'I would want to highlight two inconsistencies between your stated view and your circumstance. It doesn't seem like the vegans are ""forcing"" veganism upon the group, but rather being insufferably rude when vegan meals are not provided. Secondly, the word ""legitimate"" is used to defend the dietary options of others, but invites analysis of the vegan moral argument which you previously state is outside the scope of the discussion. Some arguments (which you can evaluate) would be: 1. The moral permissibly (an interpretation of ""legitimacy"" if we don't just care about laws which are actually kind of funny in some states) of a diet is dependent upon the process by which the food is obtained/prepared. Example: A diet comprised of still-beating human heart is not legitimate because it necessitates the killing of a human being which is morally reprehensible. 2. It is morally reprehensible to constrain the diet of another person if their diet is morally permissible. Example: If someone eats apples and oranges from their orchard, and you force them not eat oranges anymore, this is morally reprehensible. So, I think you see that the answer to your question hinges on the ""legitimacy"" (i.e. moral permissibly) of non-vegan diets. I think it would be quite difficult to convince you one way or another without evaluating that topic further. I think the best I could do is say that: If the vegans are contributing money/work towards a meal that they expect to be able to eat, only to find that it doesn't conform to their dietary standards, that is morally reprehensible. Outside of betraying an expectation that their diet be accommodated, I don't think you can get much further without evaluating the implications of either diet.'.

It seems in your premise that they are pretty ""ok"" with the idea of eliminating us, as if **it is the only way to protect the planet**? Sure they can argue we are the biggest threat, but if they are fighting to protect the earth for that reason, why shouldn't we fight to protect ourselves if we feel threatened like they feel earth is by us?

If they don't give us any information that is actually undeniable proof that we are going to destroy what they are saying we are, which I think is very unlikely, they have no reason to simply expect us to comply, since their idea of balance, is to give us no proper ground to make an educated choice, and only ask us to trust them, strangers, even though we had plenty of reason not to trust things we don't know nothing about, since they can harm us.

"The argument: '&gt;Africans, when left to their own devices, are incapable of creating well functioning societies. If true, this points to a *cultural* problem, not a problem with genes or intelligence, because a ""well functioning society"" is the consequence of certain ideas, values and beliefs. It does not point to an inferiority of race and genes, it points to an inferiority of culture. Ideas and values are taught things and learnt things that *are not* reliant on IQ - even a 5 year old child will understand the morality they are being taught not intellectually but intuitively. So the question is; what values are Africans being taught, and what should they be taught? A civilised society only requires the removal of force from that society and the instillation of the value of *individual* private property rights, which means and *end to stealing* and the growth of respect for each other's private property. In my limited understanding, African societies still largely value communal/tribal sharing above and beyond individual property ownership, with an often blurry delineation between ""mine and ""yours"". &gt;IQ IQ - just like physical Strength or Speed - does not cause virtues or vices or morality (or how good a person you are). &gt;History. &gt;Black people, historically, have made no significant societal advancements on their own....would still live in small primitive tribes and little mud huts...

Today, any country is part of the western world that culturally values reason/logic over faith/feelings/superstitions.

"The argument: 'a. What you're referring to is the labor theory of value. In a capitalist system, goods and services are valued for what they're are actually worth, not how much work was put into them. Individuals are rewarded for providing valuable goods and services to others (yes, including hedgefund managers). Ex 1: A man who spends a year digging a well with a spoon and a man who spends a week digging it with a shovel have completed the same task, with the same end result, but the man with the shovel will be able to deliver 52 times more value to others per year and thus will generate more income. Capitalist systems reward individuals for providing the maximum value to others. Ex 2: Two carpenters build chairs in the same amount of time. The first carpenter is more skilled and builds a chair that will last many years. The second builds a flimsy chair that might last one. The first carpenter is creating a more valuable product (the same applies to services like labor) and thus can charge more. b. If someone is able to live off of the good fortune of their family so what? It's not a zero sum game. Their wealth does not make you any less wealthy. In fact, by either investing or spending the wealth they have they are increasing demand for goods and services (including labor) and their wealth is being reallocated to economic positions of greater efficiency. c. What you have described is actually the opposite of capitalism! When Adam Smith (the intellectual grandfather of capitalism) wrote his ""The Wealth of Nations,"" he was specifically writing AGAINST government interference on behalf of big business. Capitalism is the ABSENCE of government interference. Lobbyists, the military-industrial complex, and crony corporations are all examples of what true capitalism would prevent.

I am personally grateful for people like you who work in opposition to those who would utilize people as mere objects because that seems to make the world a better place for me and for others. Your caring and my gratitude for your caring, however, are expressions of our personal, human values, not reflective of some objective moral truth. The objective truth is that organisms tend to capitalize on available resources in their environment and some of the most concentrated nutritious resources are walking around inside of animals. The way that things have worked, if some creature were to have developed a moral dissuasion from eating animals, this leaves more animals for those creatures which no such qualms to prey upon. This world has been around much longer than human morality has been able to question its morality and even humans are divided on what to make of it. Given this, I find it quite unlikely that the universe really cares about'morality' as humans define it. I don't wish to diminish the validity of your feelings about this state of affairs.

"The argument: 'Okay, so your friend is not wrong that in theory by cutting out the middle-men and creating a true peer-to-peer trade system you inevitably create a more socially equitable system that more fairly enables laborers at any level. *However*, there are two extreme fallacies with this optimism. 1. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not fully-fledged and implemented paradigms. They are still ventures. Yes, the bitcoin culture may be fronting or legitimately pushing some progressive agendas, but at the end of the day Bitcoin, like any other currency or corporate contract, only has as much value as consumers believe in it. Every investor who jumps onto the Bitcoin ship is enabling the early adopters logarithmically more than the late adopters. Since the early adopters generally started with capital to invest, and are already set to be the richest in the Bitcoin market--**the poor are disenfranchised before they even enter it**. This is not unique to Bitcoin; every new democratized paradigm, from iPhones and the internet all the way back to colonial trade, has generally only rewarded early investors and otherwise treated the rest as consumers. By the time it gains enough traction to attract or help the poor, the new aristocracy is already established. Financial mobility is a myth outside of the extremely lucky outliers. 2. Bitcoin is still a currency system like any other. Any sufficiently adopted economic paradigm will eventually invite entrepreneurs to *create* middle-man positions. Insurances, investments, speculations, brokerages. Given enough time, especially with enough generations to normalize loss of liberty by forgetting the uncomfortable transitions, we will see Bitcoin equivalents. The United States tried to reboot itself as a ""free"" country, and now look at where we are--over time, bureaucracy has infiltrated every nook it can. In any society where capitalism exists, freedom will eventually be exploited by those savvy enough to write in extra rules of the game.

You can easily observe evolution in action: the development of drug-resistant bacteria. That is not controversial. However it is a big leap from there to saying that life arose out of lifeless molecules and evolved from bacteria to Einstein. Likewise, dating fossils and rocks essentially involves observing how things change over short periods of time and extrapolating that back hundreds of millions of years.

Democracy did not lead to the ""election"" of Donaljei Drumpf in the early 21st Century, concentration of wealth did. Without corrupt influence of wealth, as well as the distress felt by these ""jobless"" Usans, his destruction of everything that country held dear could never have taken place. Furthermore, this system led to the widespread flooding and crop failures of the 22nd and 23rd centuries caused by increasing temperatures, the main cause of the Collapse.'.

"The argument: 'I would say there is an important distinction that needs to be made in your argument. Are you referring to a policy or is this about morality? For clarity: The policy to incentivize marriage is just that, an incentive -via the tax structure. It is not a limit on who can marry. Capturing the pool of people who can procreate and encouraging them to do so may result in some exceptions. Those exceptions may not be known (infertility) until the policy is executed. Next, we need to establish why such a policy should exist. Nations are built on culture and economy. In order to perpetuate the two you must create future citizens (prefer a lot), raise them in a culturally affirmative environment, release them into you economy to increase value (and pay taxes), and possibly have them defend the nation during wartime. If that is the reason for encouraging marriage the policy has to be both a benefit and it must be exclusionary (otherwise it wouldn't be an incentive). A group (not individual exceptions) that would not be able to fulfill the policy goal at the outset would be a valid group to exclude. From a moral standpoint we get into the realm of marriage as a religious (cultural) institution. If this is to be thought of as independent of the government then the response is simple -marriage is an institution of the respective culture and beholden to it's traditional rules. Since there is no government sanctioned benifit in this scenario, there is nothing to argue.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'While I agree with you on beer being more varied, ""complex"" is a harder call. I think your average, run-of-the-mill beer is less complex than your average run-of-the-mill wine. When you get into exotic varieties of either, the difference in complexity disappears, or in some rare cases can shift to the beer (have you ever had Firestone Anniversary 17? It's a barrel-aged blend... OMG, the flavors that develop as you taste it warp around like you're on drugs... oh wait... you can taste the entire history of that beer, and the complexity of every one of the beers that go into the blend... wow... nothing like it that I've ever experienced in wine). But that's pretty rare. Where I think you're off base is in your reduction of what is ultimately a subjective experience into a science experiment. It doesn't *matter* what factors go into the experience of complexity of a good wine, because the complexity is mostly in the mind of the beholder. ABX comparisons don't really tell you anything. If someone experiences complexity in a wine because they think it's expensive and well-rated, they *experience* that complexity, and it's completely valid. Games like dying white wine red are missing the point. The color changes how you experience the wine. If something as simple as dying the wine can change your experience of it entirely, then indeed it *is* more complex, not less. The fact that you can't change the experience of beer as much by dying it is actually a strike against it in the complexity of the subjective experience of drinking it. '.

"The argument: 'The real question here is about the value of a liberal arts education. Well, there are two questions: the value of a liberal arts education and the value of learning ""practical skills"". I can only speak to my own school experience. Here's your thesis: &gt; The core classes taught on subjects like math, history, literature, and science, are actually way more useful and beneficial in making well-rounded and intelligent adults than a curriculum more focused on financial responsibility, getting jobs, and other common wisdom ‘life skills.’ But here's the problem: while liberal arts are nice (and I'm including the sciences and math here, not just the humanities), you *actually need the life skills*. I haven't had any ""life skills"" classes since 8th grade. Nothing in high school prepared me for ""life skills"" (with the exception of that one year of Health/PE); nothing in college prepared me for ""life skills"" either. As a result, I was *unprepared in life skills*. There's a lot in navigating the adult world that people really ought to know. It would be different if those core classes actually focused on life skills. Take social studies, for example. When I went to high school, freshman year was non-required Geography, sophomore year was World History, junior year was US History, and senior year was split Government and Economics. These are all important. Which one of those is most important? Easy: Government. And it's pushed off to senior year and only given half a year (at my school, it was AP while Economics was not, so in practice Economics was pretty much ignored). Maybe things are different now or they're different elsewhere, but I think we might be going into too much detail on minutiae and not spending enough time on the things that matter. Yeah, I'm glad that I can tell you about the Republican Party split in the 1880's that led to Garfield's assassination. I listened to Jonathan Coulton's song about the presidents, where he said that Garfield was assassinated in 1882 -- or maybe it was ""1880, too"" -- but either way, it's wrong because it was in 1881; he'd served less than a year.

"The argument: 'Taxes can only work so much. Singapore is not that far from Kuala Lumpur where the price of a pack of cigarettes is even cheaper. If taxes were raised so much as to become unaffordable then they could just start a black market of ushering in cigarettes from abroad. Or people could just go elsewhere to get their fix (a much more extreme option, and this point they would have likely detered atleast a few smokers). The thing is that taxes can't effectively prevent smoking by themselves especially when price disparities exist in such proximity to one another. Furthermore, an age limit could be kind of like a cultural signal from the government. Making someone look like they're doing something illegal rather than just paying taxes for it could make it less socially acceptable. And you've already mentioned that people hide the fact that they're smoking when they're younger. Furthermore, the prevention of smoking is tricky. Smoking inherently contains a drug which makes you addicted to smoking. Even trying one pack has the the potential to hook you.

"The argument: 'Most of the posts here reflect a lack of understanding of the details of evolution. You're getting a lot of bad answers. The truth is that you may be partially right. The science of evolution is still in debate and it is not yet fully understood. Darwin himself theorized that there existed an ""evolution of evolvability"" that we would one day discover. During recent decades, there has been some debate over whether there was evidence of ""adaptive mutations"", meaning non-random mutations by microbes in response to environmental conditions. Ultimately, my understanding is that the community decided the evidence was that such mutations were actually random. As someone else pointed out, epigenetics is a field that studies how the environment can effect what genes get passed on and expressed. We still don't know how DNA and genes interact. And we have no way of actually observing mutation over millions of years at the chemical level. Personally, I agree with Darwin that there is probably some kind of evolution of evolvability. But right now we don't have a clue what that mechanism might be. And whenever we look really close at the mutation process, it appears to be completely random. '.

"The argument: 'So there's this really interesting term called an [""alief""](http://www.pgrim.org/philosophersannual/pa28articles/gendleraliefbelief.pdf) that the philosopher Tamar Gendler recently coined. She is interested in a number of interesting questions, but I'll take this as an example (quote from the linked essay): &gt; So, for example, subjects are reluctant to drink from a glass of juice in which a completely sterilized dead cockroach has been stirred, hesitant to wear a laundered shirt that has been previously worn by someone they dislike, and loath to eat soup from a brand-new bedpan. They are disinclined to put their mouths on a piece of newly- purchased vomit-shaped rubber (though perfectly willing to do so with sink stopper of similar size and material), averse to eating fudge that has been formed into the shape of dog feces, and far less accurate in throwing darts at pictures of faces of people they like than at neutral faces. Another place this shows up is nightmares. Have you ever had a nightmare about, say, getting murdered by someone hiding in the backseat of your car and then felt jumpy getting into the car the next day? We don't say that *you believe you are going to die*. That would be silly. Obviously you know the difference between reality and dreams. Just like you know *rationally* that the fudge isn't poop, that shooting a cut-out of your friend isn't dangerous, that the glass of juice is clean, etc etc. It is these mental states that Tamar Gendler terms ""aliefs."" We don't really believe them. We just kinda act like we do. We alieve it instead of believing it.

The only reason the universe *looks* deterministic to our limited senses is that a very large number of random events averages out to something that looks extremely deterministic. This is inevitable, due to the cleverly named ""Law of Large Numbers"". The Central Limit Theorem helps too. Is it possible that there are hidden variables that explain the apparent randomness of QM? Technically, but in order for that to be true, the speed of light would have to not be a barrier to information exchange, because Bell's Theorem mathematically proves that you can't have both locality and realism (which devolves to determinism), even if there are hidden variables, and still measure the results that we have unambiguously measured innumerable times. We've looked for violations of the speed of light limit even more innumerable times, and haven't found them. Special Relativity is one of the most thoroughly proven ideas in science. In any event, your position is called ""incompatiblism"" by people who talk about free will. There are other theories that say that free will is compatible with pure determinism.

"The argument: 'You can't see the forest when you are in it. Musical personalities, as you called them, are defined in retrospect. No one thought there was a 90's sound during the 90's. The only reason why we think there is a 90s sound now is because it's been 25 years since the 90s started (and 15 since they ended.) It's only been 5 years since 2010. If you wait another 10 years, people will definitely be able to pick up on a distinctive 00's sound. As another example, just think about how long it takes a car to go from new to used to vintage to antique. It's really easy to pick up on the difference between a 70s car, an 80s car, and a 90s car, but it's tough to do the same for a 2000s car. But it's becoming more and more obvious with time. The big reason why is the change is gradual. It happens so slowly that it's hard to pick out a distinctive shift. People with glaucoma slowly lose their peripheral vision until they go blind, yet many of them don't even notice it. They lose a tiny bit of vision everyday without realizing. And that's their literal eyesight. Picking out a distinctive 2000's sound is going to be way harder than something you stare out of 16 hours a day, everyday. '.

I don't want to trivialize the topic, but, let me pitch a hypothetical- What if I believe democracy is evil? What if(despite I know the reality of the situation is that if I don't vote, I don't get a say so), I believe that allowing people who I believe to be uneducated, who don't share the same morales as I do to have a say in electing officials and policies that directly effect my living space, is wrong? What if I also believe that (despite our government being advertised as a ""democracy"")most likely my vote wouldn't ultimately matter given the current political climate? You could say ""lol, you're SOL then. Gtfo of 'Murica"". But that sidesteps a major logical flaw- why shouldn't I /ever/ be able to complain about a political outcome, /particularly/ because I believe the system is flawed from the inside out?

"The argument: 'The weakest point of your proof is the definition of an ""observer"". In Quantum Mechanics, the term ""observer"" is often misinterpreted as being a conscious/sapient being, but that is completely unnecessary, just as one example of the weakness of this definition. Does an observer have to ""observe"" to meet your requirements? For example, let us suppose that there is a completely closed system, which even in principle no sapient being in the outside universe can observe. Say the inside of a black hole. That sapient non-observer (by any reasonable definition) can make a proposition about what is happening inside the black hole, and that proposition can correspond with the facts (or not) even if it is absolutely impossible for the non-observer to verify that truth. I think it might be correct to say that without a *proposition-maker* there can't be a ""truth"" if you define ""truth"" in this extremely narrow way.

"The argument: 'I think the basic problem with your view is this: In an environment where cheating is not taken seriously, reporting it is useless, because nothing serious will be done about it. In an environment where cheating is taken seriously, reporting it is not necessary, because people will either develop an environment of trust and learn a lot better as a result, or else they will be too afraid to cheat. In either case, the amount of cheating will be low enough that it won't cause any serious problems. In my college, cheating was an honor code violation that was taken very seriously, and was ""prosecuted"" primarily by student members of the Honor Committee, who not only were known and trusted for their probity, and well supported by the administration, but highly motivated to avoid the development of a cheating-friendly environment for all the reasons you point out. As a result, most of our tests were actually take-home, closed-book tests. I know it sounds insane, but that system actually worked well in that environment. And that environment of trust is really what you need to be aiming for, because it's the best way to get people to work together rather than against each other. Ultimately, then, the right approach is not to work for an environment where all cheating is *reported*, because that's nigh unto useless. It's to work on promoting an environment where cheating is taken very seriously, at which point you won't really have this problem. Worrying about reporting doesn't solve anything.

When I find out about a weird new astronomical phenomenon, or a new disease, or a new picture of giant squid that never had been captured before, it doesn't decrease the mystery of the world, it makes me curious to know even more. And that has been the history of science since basically forever. Basically, I think you're missing the point about mystery. Something can't actually be mysterious until you know something about it. There's nothing mysterious about some teacup floating in space near Mars because we never have discovered one... if we found such a thing, it would open up *tremendous* amounts of mystery and curiosity.

Take, for instance, how you imply that Pluto stopped being a planet. But that's not true at all - Pluto was *never* a planet. You see, whenever we say planet, it is implied that we are reffering to the definition of ""planet"" which is set by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU changed the defintion of planet in 2006, and under this new defintion pluto no longer meets the qualifications to be a planet.

"The argument: 'So you've agreed that speech can be restricted when it acts like aggression against another person. But speech has other practical consequences besides just aggression. Some speech is more than just simply speech. For example, if you say ""I agree to pay you for that hotel room"", it creates a contract, at the very least an implied one, if not an actual one. If you say to a politician, ""I agree to pay you if you do what I want"" we call that bribery, because politicians accept (via laws that they agree to when the run) restrictions on their right to accept payments (either literal or in-kind) when they sign on to be a candidate. In both of these cases, the *context* of the speech matters. If you jokingly tell your friend that you'll pay him for a hotel room, it doesn't create this kind of contract, because the hotel room isn't his to rent out. If you tell the same friend ""I agree to pay you if you do what I want"" it's not *necessarily* bribery, because your friend hasn't agreed to any kind of societal or individual contract that says he's not allowed to do that. If the ""what I want"" happens to be slipping you some of his company's stationary on the side, though, suddenly it becomes interference in a contract. The problem with expensive documentaries that support particular candidates published during an election campaign is that they have the practical effect of being bribery. The fact that it's implicit rather than explicit doesn't really change this. The same documentary run outside of some election cycle isn't effectively an ""in-kind"" donation to the candidate, because it doesn't have any immediate effect that the politician can benefit from. So... with saying some sentence to your friend, the context changes whether it's simple free speech, or an incitement to fraud, theft, or interference in a contract. Documentaries published in times when they will have a material effect on an election that benefits a candidate in a way that is prohibited are similar.

"The argument: 'Let's leave out for a moment the purpose that tips actually serve, which is a form of profit sharing that allows restaurants to hire more servers than they need during slow times in order to have them available for busy times, while roughly compensating them for the total amount of work that they have to actually do. Percentage tipping is basically a simplified shortcut for level of service. Let's consider courses. Should you tip the same for an entree as you tip for an appetizer, soup, salad, entree, and dessert? If so, I think you're not compensating the waiter fairly for the amount of service that they provide. But, indeed, that's almost all the difference in prices between differing meals. It's relatively small potatoes to worry about the price of any one of the dishes. The ""percentage"" rule is just a simplified way of calculating this compensation. It needn't always apply, necessarily. Indeed, in many cases, people don't tip the full percentage on their more expensive wine purchases for exactly the reason that it seems out of scope with the difference level of service. But that's because the difference in wine prices is far, far larger than the difference in entree prices. If you want to use a more complicated algorithm, fine. Tips aren't mandatory in any case (the ones that are are called service charges). Of course, your waiter isn't necessarily going to go to all the trouble to figure out if your specific tip fits some algorithm that they can't possibly know, so don't be surprised if your tips end up out of alignment with what they expect. This may well be reflected in your future service. Or not.

"The argument: 'It's a confusing word. Sorry, some words are just confusing. Quick, what does ""set"" mean? The basic problem is that ""gender"" means something different to different people and in different contexts. That's not really that uncommon. So here: Most times, when transgender people talk about gender, it's my experience talking with them that they are talking about gender identity, and that, yes, this is what body parts feel ""natural"" to them. You feel natural having 5 fingers. If you suddenly and inexplicably had 4, you'd probably still feel like you should have 5. That's pretty easy to understand... but what if for some inexplicable reason, you felt like you should have 6 fingers? And that it felt as weird to you to have 5 fingers as most people would feel if they suddenly had 4, or a weird bifurcated tentacle thing at the end of their arm. Do some people mean gender roles when they talk about this? Sure. Words are flexible. You might have to ask for some clarification of what they mean. They are in a very strange situation, so don't be surprised if they have a hard time explaining it. They're generally doing the best they can. Sometimes ""gender"" means sex. Sometimes it means ""gender roles"". Sometimes it means ""gender identity"" as I described above. Sometimes it means all of the above. Again, what does ""set"" mean? It's not at all unusual for words to have many, and complicated, meanings. That doesn't make the word useless or meaningless, it just means that it depends on context. And sometimes you're going to find yourself out of context and will have to ask. Other times it will be obvious what is meant. That's life. '.

"The argument: 'Although you're skeptical of taxes and government oversight I recommend that you read about [carbon pricing]. Carbon pricing, typically introduced as a carbon tax, is a way to price greenhouse gas emissions into the economy. Let's break this down a bit though, since it involves some modestly technical economics: Economies are complex systems that adapt to signals. When I signal that I want to buy something other people tend to try to produce that good or service for sale. It's a pretty fabulous system. Economic activity, however, can produce externalities. Externalities are costs or benefits that are born by third parties. Typically these costs or benefits are not figured into the system's ordinary signaling mechanisms. Let's use pollution as an example: when I ship a package from A to B there's a third party, C, that is affected by the emissions produced by my shipping the package. So when I FedEx a chair from my house to my uncle's house, for example, the truck that carries the chair produces emissions. These emissions are a cost borne by everyone: my neighbours, other drivers, local plants and animals, everyone suffers from my shipping emissions. But the system doesn't respond very well to this cost. Usually costs bear immediately on prices (e.g. the cost of labour) but this cost is so diffuse that nobody accounts for it. The consequence? Lots of emissions and *nobody* taking responsibility for them. This is where carbon pricing comes in. Carbon pricing is when carbon or other greenhouse gases are ""priced in"" to the economy, which means that those who produce the emissions have to pay for them. In the case of my shipping a package, the I'd have to pay a fee for the emissions I caused by shipping the package. This additional cost will make me reconsider how I go about my business. Since the emissions from shipping are so low I'll likely not change very much, but if I see a change to ship in bulk, rather than by individual unit, I'll take it. The same holds true when carbon pricing is applied to the whole economy. Industries will tend away from high-emitting activities and towards lower-emitting activities. This is good. When lots of people tend, however slightly, towards lowering their emissions then big change happens. We've seen this",[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],2.0,True,False,Technology,"Achievement,Face,Security: societal,Benevolence: dependability"

If I can see that someone obviously appears male or female by modern social standards, then I have an immediate and visible cue which of those 2 genders the person probably prefers to identify with, and how to refer to them. I ask you, assuming you're a male, imagine that you walk up to people and they mostly start calling you ""she"". How does that feel in your mental self-image? Is is literally nothing more than ""huh, they got it wrong, obviously they're an idiot""? Or does your own self-indentification in some way ""matter"" to you? Do you have any sense of feeling like you're in some way ""wrong"" if people make this mistake a lot? Is it your deodorant? Are you dressing funny? Is it your hair? Is it the way you walk? Why, why why? Now... even if it doesn't matter to you, personally, can you honestly say that you have no idea why it would matter to *anyone*? The only way that could be true is if it literally doesn't matter what gender you are. We don't live in such a society.

"The argument: 'I think the ""Islamic Terrorism"" label is itself pretty deeply dishonest. Consider this: If you combine the Muslim populations of India and Indonesia, the total is greater than *all the Muslims in the entire Middle East and North Africa combined*. And yet how many attacks on the West have originated in India or Indonesia? There are Muslim terrorist groups in both those regions, but they tend to pick fights internally based on national politics, not the ""general hatred for the West's way of life"" or the Quran commanding they kill all infidels. The vast, vast, vast majority of ""Islamic Terrorists"" we in the West refer to originate in the Middle East, and just as common as their allegiance to Islam is their professing of historical grievances against the West, particularly the West's unconditional support for Israel. Even those who are homegrown tend to explicitly cite Western actions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and other places the where the US has actively intervened in the past half-century. Even the Boston bombers, Eastern European in origin, cited anger over the Iraq and Afghanistan wars as driving their actions. I think a much more accurate, much more *honest* label, would ""Arab-Muslim Anti-Imperialist Terrorism"" or even just ""Anti-Imperialist Terrorism"". The vast majority of terror attacks vs. the West originate in the Middle East or are directly inspired by ME politics. The entire ME &amp; NA together make up 20% of the global Muslim population. You have to subdivide out the Sunnis from that, and from the Sunnies the Wahhabists, and from the Wahhabists the Salafi Jihadists, before you start to get a label that truly approaches accuracy without painting with too broad a brush.

"The argument: 'Yes, the system may be gaming you. However, it may also be not gaming you. There were, there are and there will be government conspiracies. However, they are a rare thing. You are very unlikely to get into experimentation program because of how unlikely they are. If one cares about running the numbers then I suppose one could see that getting in human experimentation program and getting harmed there is way less probable that getting harmed by malpractice (I assume that because of Hanlon's razor). So rational person entering hospital should be afraid of being harmed by conspiracy way less than he should be afraid of getting harmed by malpractice. The thing is, many people really underestimate how hard it is to make a good conspiracy - and thus grossly overestimate likelyhood of various conspiracies. When confronted by counter-evidence, instead of updating their beliefs to a more probable model without conspiracy, that also conforms to evidence, they update their beliefs to a less probable model with conspiracy *and* anti-counter-evidence clause (CIA agents fouling the trail to cover up for FBI). That way of thinking at first strikes some people as irrational - and, after several failed attempts of reasoning, as *infuriatingly* irrational. The most vivid memory of person questioning if there's a conspiracy around is an image of some wacko. If you ask similar questions, that impression will be imposed on you too and that kinda prevents reasonable discussion. Back on track, if you don't have a specific evidence in favour of conspiracy and you suspect there *might* be one then you also should be *terrified* about malpractice. And you shouldn't be terrified about malpractice either - expected impact on your health is positive. Malpractice is uncommon. Conspiracies are rare as albino unicorns.'.

"The argument: 'Ultimately, if everything else stays the same, but everyone in the country gets a degree because it's ""free"", then everyone in the country will end up paying a similar amount in taxes that they would have paid back on their student loans. And you can't discharge taxes in bankruptcy any more than you can get rid of student loan debt... for kind of obvious reasons (the entire point of taxes is that you're forced to pay them). Progressive taxation helps a little... but those Harvard, MIT, and Stanford grads with huge bills are pretty likely to be the ones in the high income brackets paying it. It's pretty likely to even out there as well. Inflation and continuing increases in tuition due to increased demand without increased supply won't be that different from the interest they are paying on student loans today. The reason some countries can do this is that they strictly control university costs, and heavily invest in increasing university capacity. But, of course, we could do that too if we wanted to, without also making college ""free"" for everyone. But while I don't think our universities are *proportionally* that much better than the rest of the world, on an absolute scale they are by far the best in the world (by most metrics, at least 10 of the top 15 schools in the world are in the US... and the others are in Britain (Oxford and Cambridge) which has pretty similar effective tuitions after accounting for financial aid, and Switzerland... which is tiny and very rich). Measurement gets much more varied after this, but in most studies of universities, the U.S. has 40-50 out of the top 100 as well. Yes, they are very expensive, but there is a degree to which you get what you pay for. That controlling of costs that governments do comes at a cost in quality. '.

I'm sure there are people complaining that it's mostly brown people that stupidly believe the Earth was created 10,000 years ago (racism is not rational). However, most are doing it because of Islamophobia, which in spite of what some people want you to believe, really is not the same thing as racism. Following an ideology is a choice, and a behavior, not something you are born with. It might still be a stupid prejudice, but it's a *different* stupid prejudice, at least for most people. '.

Furthermore, are plainly conditions on the ground from failed Arab Spring revolts, and (likely global warming)droughts.

The way that the 2 party system changes over time is by the platforms and selected candidates from the 2 parties changing, which we do see. Both parties have to appeal to a broad mainstream of the populace in order to have any chance at being elected, which prevents them from becoming too extreme. The problem with this election isn't that the Republicans or Democrats are too extreme, it's that the *populace* has become too extreme, and no voting system can really protect against that. But with a multiparty system like an at-large percentage-based parliament, you have the opposite problem that extreme parties can gain *significant* political power. This happens because ultimately, a law is either passed or not. In order to get things done, mainstream parties have to compromise with extreme parties in order to get the votes necessary to pass laws.

They get credit for the good parts of this, but don't get the blame for the ultimate unintended consequences, mostly because people don't understand unintended consequences or take a long view.

But they have actual needs, and as a society we have a moral obligation to not abandon people in need (exactly how we go about it can be debated endlessly). It really doesn't matter how tiny their proportion of the population is. When people go without genuine needs being met, we diminish ourselves as a social species (to our peril, ultimately). No group is ""too small"" or too peripheral to make accommodations for and to assist in need, when it only conflicts with other peoples ""wants"". The only real question is where that balance is met. If feeding the poor actually meant depriving others of shelter, that would be inappropriate. If creating some *particular* accommodation was wildly inefficient to the point of actually causing problems, then alternatives should be looked for. Perhaps wider corridors is too expensive... fine... find some *other* way to meet the need. Ramps for people in wheelchairs are also expensive, but without them disabled people actually can't participate meaningfully in society. They have a *need* for this accommodation whereever it can be made... Or alternately, a stairway chairlift can fit in almost any place where a ramp cannot. Now... this obviously can be taken too far. Going to great lengths to make something more *convenient* for a tiny group while at the same time making it vastly much harder for most people would be a bad tradeoff. But it's a tradeoff.

Ok. Now, also in 2009, around [3 trillion vehicle miles were traveled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year).

If most people on highways with 65mph speed limits currently travel 70 mph (not easy to get these statistics, but it fits my experience pretty well), that would mean that your view would cost around 330 million hours lost per year.

Now it gets weird... let's suppose that these neurons, one at a time, are replaced with double neurons, each acting exactly in all ways just like a pair of neurons used to act, sending the same signals to the adjacent pairs of neurons.

Because, contrary to what you have stated elsewhere, math isn't a ""real"" thing. It's a concept. It's nothing more than defining some terms and some rules for applying those terms consistently. It entirely possible to define something in math that doesn't exist ""in reality"". Imaginary numbers are an example of this. They are a handy way of calculating things that actually happens in reality, but no one really believes that you can have the square root of minus 1 apples. Indeed, the entire concept of negative numbers isn't something exists ""in reality"". There's no way to have ""minus 1 apples"" except conceptually (e.g. you could say that I owe you one apple, but that's not a ""real -1 apple"" that someone has, it's just bookkeeping). Or, you could define a kind of geometry (called ""non Euclidean"") where parallel lines eventually meet, or where parallel lines get farther apart from each other. No one says that all of these geometries ""really exist"", though it's an open question which of them we might actually live in. Basically, your statement is very unclear.

There is, at most, a right not to be killed, and even that's not inalienable, because you can give up that right by infringing on the rights of others in various ways (self-defense with legitimate use of lethal force, for example). To the degree that such a thing exists, the right to not be killed being ""inalienable"" means that you can not give up this right by any kind of contract or agreement. You cannot allow someone to kill you legally, because your right not to be killed is *inalienable*. That's what the word means. It's inherently logically impossible for *both* the right to not be killed *and* the right to death to be ""inalienable"". The latter isn't even coherent, though. If the right to death were ""inalienable"", then you couldn't agree to allow people to resuscitate you, which is clearly nonsense. Indeed, we *regularly* resuscitate people who do not have any kind of ""living will"" saying whether or not that should be done to them. Perhaps you mean that you have a right to kill yourself, and that no one has the right to stop you. Perhaps this is based on the idea that killing yourself is solely your choice because it only affects you negatively. While I sympathize with that idea, killing yourself very nearly *never* is free from negative externalities that affect others, unlike the right to not be killed (to the degree that we actually have such a thing and don't give it up). If you actually had any kind of ""inalienable right to life"" that forced people to actually help you stay alive in any way, then it's *obvious* that you can't have a right to kill yourself, either... because people would in some way be compelled (or at least allowed) to try to preserve your life.

So in this way long before we having every single job obliterated, or a completely autonomous economy we will have a substantially autonomous economy, where simply put, there isn't enough work for everyone. How many programmers or database engineers do you need when the computer can program itself? How many kitchen servers or chefs do you need when you can have safe, relatively healthy food made available for little to no cost, all transported in and by a logistics system from farm to store, by varieties of systems, many if not all of which would be automated. To be sure the artisan movement can save the best sous chef, or the small mom and pop shop from obliteration, for a time. My question is what happens when 20-30 or 40% unemployment isn't due to some bad policy but by virtue of the success of our systems and governance? In that way, the question is to be asked, not in the utopian Star Trek sense of things, it's the vast and yawning gap where scarcities will exist and you will simply have vast amount of unemployment into a positive effect of the economy that generates taxable revenue. So the question is - to my mind - what system - other than some sort of seriously refactored socialist system where taxation provides services, income and meaningful educational opportunities for those unemployable in the automated economy. In that way, one can say we have suffered some long series along these lines, with the first bits of industrial automation and the railings of Karl Marx, I'll put it slightly differently, it seems to me a vast waste of human capital, to say nothing of obscenely dangerous to the order of things. We historically, do not engage in such a support system that allows the vast majority of displaced workers to explore alternative employment; or at least we kind of suck at",[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1.],1.0,True,False,General,"Achievement,Security: personal,Universalism: tolerance,Universalism: objectivity"

"The argument: 'The basic problem here is that there's really no such thing as ""biological race"". The differences among members of a social group perceived as a ""race"" are typically far larger than the differences *between* social groups perceived as ""different races"". Indeed, Africa has a broader genetic diversity than basically the entire rest of the human race combined, which shouldn't be too surprising considering that we're all descended from them. This problem is very susceptible to confirmation bias. Some studies have shown, for example, certain characteristics that seem to cluster along with one's continent of origin. However, later studies showed that you can make very nearly *any* geographical division, and find genetic markers and similarities among people from those divisions. Examples studied included ""people from countries that start with the letter N"", as well as ""people from Iceland or Madagascar"" (lol). Genetic information is so rich that you can find common markers based on almost *any* division. Basically, it's the confirmation bias of people that chose to look for markers based on *continent*, because of preconceived notions of ""races"" that come from those continents. It's useful to research particular *genes* and their effects, certainly. I doubt very many people would deny that. It's almost never going to be useful to say ""this gene helps to cause X, therefore 'blacks' are more likely to... X"" for very nearly any X. There are a few rare exceptions. Blacks (those with darker skin) are less likely to contract melanoma... because their skin blocks more UV. One might be right, as you point out, to say that ""people descended recently from this region of Zimbabwe are more likely to X""... but that's not really a ""race"", because it's not a recognizable social group. But even better would just be to say ""people with gene Y, predominantly found in this region of Zimbabwe, are more likely to X"". I.e. it's almost always going to be a misleading and scientifically useless thing to say to talk about ""differences between races"".'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

How is.99... being equal to 1 unpredictable? What problems or inconsistencies does it produce? Edit: &gt; 0 represents a state of no value. This is incorrect too by the way, or at least it's very poorly phrased. ""No value"" and 0 are not the same. If you wanted to take the average temperature of a city every day for a year, you would measure the temperature each day, add them together, and divide by 365. If you later decide you only want the temperature during for the summer season, you wouldn't just do the same calculation, replacing all non-summer days with 0. You'd omit those entirely. That's the difference between 0 and no value. &gt; I believe the same situation occurs when using ""infinity"" as if it were an actual quantity instead of a concept. No one is using infinity as a quantity. It's used to describe things like sequences that go on without bound. '. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

Denying a fetus the use of your body results in it's death but only because a fetus cannot survive without the mother. I use this example a lot, but consider a case where there is a sick person hooked up to you with some contraption that allows them to use your liver to filter their blood because they are sick and cannot use their own liver. You didn't agree to be hooked up to this person, you just woke up and found yourself here. If they disconnect from your body, they die. However, they do not have a right to use your body unless you consent to it. If you decide you don't consent, you can unhook yourself, and leave. The person dies. Oh well, they didn't have a right to use your body anyway.

"The argument: '&gt; The reason PC games are becoming shit full of things like DRM is because of pirating. DRM does not seek to prevent piracy. It's purpose is to limit where and how legitimate customers can use the software or media they bought. Anti-piracy measures that get in your way are not the fault of pirates, they are the fault of a combination of poor software engineering and a poor attitude towards customers. That is, companies think that it's so worth it to combat piracy that they degrade the experience of other users in order to prevent piracy. If you feel that anti-piracy measures are ruining games, you should vote with your dollar. Valve along with a few other game companies and many indie developers choose to not include any anti-piracy measures in their games because they recognize they do little good and serve to alienate actual customers. Edit: I suppose it might be worth it to mention that I'm a game programmer who has a fairly extensive collection of pirated games, though they're mostly from the SNES and NES era. Piracy, in my opinion, is just another market factor that companies need to compete with, and a good business will be able to compete with free by offering secondary services that improve the game play experience in a way you can't with pirated games. This is why Steam is so successful even in the face of pirates. '. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

Consider: &gt;Every constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of nineteen years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right. and &gt;Let us provide in our constitution for its revision at stated periods. What these periods should be nature herself indicates. By the European tables of mortality, of the adults living at any one moment of time, a majority will be dead in about nineteen years. At the end of that period, then, a new majority is come into place; or, in other words, a new generation. **Each generation is as independent as the one preceding, as that was of all which had gone before. It has then, like them, a right to choose for itself the form of government it believes most promotive of its own happiness**; consequently, to accommodate to the circumstances in which it finds itself that received from its predecessors; and it is for the peace and good of mankind that a solemn opportunity of doing this every nineteen or twenty years should be provided by the constitution, so that it may be handed on with periodical repairs from generation to generation to the end of time, if anything human can so long endure."" *--Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Kercheval, 1816* The Constitutional problems we face are not the result of flaws in the document, but rather a long, ongoing process of inevitable divergence. *Yes*, there is a process for amendment. *No*, that process is not actually achievable in a cultural and political climate in which it is almost impossible to do mundane things like pass a budget, appoint judges, or honor our national debt. So what's arisen is that when the Constitution doesn't work, or doesn't square with something we actually want to do as a people, we largely just ignore it.

When you drive drunk, there is a significant chance you will kill someone. It's similar to firing a gun into the air near a crowd. You have no intent to kill, you don't know for a fact that someone will be harmed, but in neither case would you say, ""he couldn't have known what would happen"". Will the two years mess up his life? Yup. But his victim's life is even more messed up. As are the friends and family of the victim.

"The argument: '&gt; Assuming I am currently ignorant of any objective moral truths, it makes sense to try and discover as many moral truths as possible and then to live my life according to them. Can you describe a moral truth that you discovered? If you have discovered it, doesn't that prove the existence of moral facts? If you have not, then how can you live your live by these moral truths without knowing what they are? I mean, couldn't one of those moral truths be ""kill everyone you meet as painfully as possible""? &gt; For example, game theory is the study of ways one **should** act within particular scenarios. Consciousness doesn’t seem to be required for the mathematical results of these games to be true. For example, trees have settled into an equilibrium in a sort of Prisoner’s Dilemma: trees will invest the energy to grow tall because trees that don’t get deprived of sunlight by trees that did. This is not quite right. ""should"" is the wrong word here. We can study trees and see how they *do* act, but not how they *should* act. Our application of game theory to the situation is a kind of personification of the tree. We are supposing that the tree has goals or aspirations - that it wants to reproduce and spread it's genes. The tree does not have goals. It is as dumb as the rock that falls. The tree just acts according to physics. It is following the rules just as much as the rock is with no goal in mind. When we think of the word'should' we are talking about conscious being's subjective judgement about how they would prefer things to be. ""Lemonade should be sweet"" is something someone might think. Another person might say ""Lemonade should be tart"". Neither of these'should' statements are more valid than they other. They are both subjective judgement. And ultimately, that's what morality is: a question of how things should be. Morality is the question ""How should I act?""

"The argument: 'Can you define what free will means? It sounds like you think it's a nebulous concept that is outisde not predetermined or random, but I don't see why this has to be the case. To me, free will is a concept that just describes the decision making process at an abstract level - free will is a function of a pre-determined (or probabilistic, it doesn't really matter) universe. Imagine you are playing a video game against an AI opponent. The rules of the game say what you *can* do, but not what you will do. You can choose to go left or go right and attack your opponent. The AI you're facing has a number of choices as to how it may counter. How it works is completely deterministic, but in the framework of the game it could make any choice permitted by the rules. The AI itself is a black box, and the process it undergoes to determine which action it will take is what we call 'choice'. The choices that the AI is making are very simple, and I'm not sure they're sufficient to say an entity has free will, but they are a necessary part, and I don't think we need to say that free will does not exist because things are deterministic. To me, concepts like Free Will are only useful if we can say what does and what does not have free will. From what I understand of your definition of free will is false a priori and cannot exist.

"The argument: '&gt; Affirmative action however creates the exact same problem. This is true to an extent. Let me start by saying that I'm not a huge fan of AA, but not because it's racist. Rather, I'm not a fan because it's my understanding that it generally doesn't work. I'm going to use a somewhat strange analogy here, but bear with me. Lets say we have a bunch of rocks that orbit a planet, sort of like the rings around Saturn. As long as these rocks don't encounter any disruptive forces that throw them out of their stable orbit, they continue on their merry way, for hundreds or thousands of years. If some comet flies by and bumps into them, the force it applies will push these rocks out of their stable orbit they'll fly off into space or crash down on to the planet and be destroyed. We can fix that though, we can take rockets, fly out into space, and push them rocks back into place. Even though the problem was caused by some other object applying force to the rock, we can push it back into stable orbit by applying even more force, just in the opposite direction. Now we have people. People who aren't victims of racism can make a good life for themselves, and raise their children in good environments, who can then go on to have good lives of their own. They're in a stable orbit, and generation after generation they'll tend to stay stable. If we apply racist forces however, suddenly these people who would have otherwise been fine lose opportunities to get jobs based on stupid things, like how their name sounds. They can't get the nice jobs, and the media depicts them as being stupid or uneducated or dangerous, and we have this feedback loop of racism that makes it hard for them to get to a point where they have the same stability that a person who didn't have to deal with racism has. We can try to fix that though, by creating affirmative action programs that help minorities out by giving them a push, helping them get out of these situations. AA is a racist force, just like the racist forces too, but it's acting in the opposite direction. Just like a rocket pushing the rocks around, it would be dumb to keep pushing forever - the idea is",[1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],3.0,True,False,Gaming,"Self-direction: thought,Achievement,Face"

"The argument: 'There is nothing wrong with our current addressing scheme if they are implemented correctly. GPS Coordinates provide the most specific addressing scheme out there and is already in universal existence. Give someone a lat/long down to specific seconds and they can find you within meters. Can't get any more specific than that. More human readable addresses, in the ""### Street &lt;type&gt;, Unit ##, City, State/District/Provence/Etc., Country, Postal Code"" work well for mailing and shipping, for navigating, and for local use. People who live and work in a local area will know that the X block of &lt;blank&gt; street starts at the intersection of &lt;cross street&gt;, for example in many cities that use a 0-0 central block, the address 700 N Elm Street indicates 7 blocks North of the central line (usually a Main Street or 1st Street/Avenue). &gt; I believe this would reduce the amount of wrong/missing adress problems that business and people face everyday I think you overestimate the number of problems that occur. Most problems are largely because of either improper typing or inaccurate information. Such as saying ""700 Elm"" is not the same as saying ""700 North Elm"", where the directional is critically important. The other issue occurs when government agencies responsible with ensuring addressing don't ensure there aren't 5 different ""Elm""s within a given city. And we're not even into talking to multi-tenant properties. ""4TJ3A Number 433"" would still exist, for example. Ultimately, a logical system where the house number is implemented on a hierarchical addressing grid from a 0-0 center point and all street names within a given political division are unique is far better than random codes being assigned. A random code gives me no immediate context. 18009 West Century Boulevard, Whatchatown, Kansas gives me immediate context. I know it's in Kansas, I know it's in or near Whatchatown, I know it's on West Century Boulevard, and I know it's in the 18000th block, meaning it's quite the distance from the city center. This gives me",[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],14.0,True,True,Gaming,"Self-direction: thought,Security: societal"
"The argument: 'There's a few reasons. The biggest one in my mind is that if GMO's are unsafe, we should not sell them period. If they are safe, there's no need to post a label. It's that simple. We label things that may contain allergens because they can cause real, demonstrable harm. We label things that may harm pregnant mothers for the same reason. GMO's haven't been demonstrated to be harmful. Adding labeling does actually imply that there is a danger with the foods, because in other cases where we label there is a real danger. Labeling has been done in other countries, and it does affect consumer purchasing patterns. It's not just a hypothetical issue. There is already a way to make sure you're not getting GMO food: buy organic. If it's an issue for you, there already exists a set of products that can be certified to not contain GMO's. For the rest of the food industry, segregating out GMO and non-GMO foods has a non-negligible cost (along with the costs of updating labels and such), and that cost gets passed on to the consumer. '.
