"The argument: 'Well...that's what free speech is. People can communicate their opinions in any way they want and people with sufficient support from others can afford to spread their message through means other than shouting on a street corner or making posts on Facebook. Telephones are publicly accessible means of communication just like mail or email or Facebook or Twitter or Reddit. I think it's fairly arbitrary to say that someone shouldn't be allowed to even attempt to engage with you politically over the phone because you didn't enjoy it. It seems like the natural consequence of that logic would be that we restrict political speech to certain approved forums where it can be expressed without inconveniencing anyone.

"The argument: '&gt;Anti-natalism You don't fully understand antinatalism, because it's not just wanting to remain childless. It's a philosophical argument positing that being born always results in net suffering, therefore having children is necessarily immoral. It also follows that it would be better for humanity and all life to die. So I don't know if ""existence is better than non-existence"" was a typo, but that's pretty much the opposite of antinatalism. Now, I really believe that no *living* person actually believes this, and they just use it to make their decision not to have children seem somehow enlightened or difficult to criticize. You like your life enough not to end it. You articulate specific ways you enjoy life and offer no indication that you want to die, so your words and behavior all suggest that your birth was better for you than your not-birth. You could not-birth yourself at any moment, but you consistently and repeatedly choose not to. That tends to suggest that you view your own life as worth living, and it follows that other births could produce lives worth living. Any living, breathing antinatalist is a living, breathing contradiction of their own view. &gt;Dating is a struggle. Women are capricious and have higher standards for men - wealthy, healthy, fit and educated all come to mind, but all men care about? Attractiveness, really. That’s it. All you've done here is describe the same thing with disparate terms. What do you mean by ""attractiveness?"" Just that she's pretty? Does that include the morbidly obese or the anorexic? Or do you want them to be reasonably fit? Do you expect them to have all their teeth and not have some communicable disease? Do you care if they're stupid? Do you care what they're like in bed? Would you mind if she's 9 inches taller than you? Do you care whether she demeans you in public? Free advice: drop the adversarial attitude towards women. They're not the enemy, and viewing them that way tends to end badly - especially if you actually want a fruitful relationship with one. &gt;Living together means your disposable income is d",[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],7.0,True,Gaming,Self-direction: action

"The argument: '1) I'm not totally up to date on French political culture, but if the cartoons or covers made by CH were unequivocally veiled criticism of the right and not actual inflammatory attacks...then were those who attacked them just confused? I'm not saying that anything they (the attackers) did was right, I just question whether they would kill many people based on what amounts to a forgotten ""/s"" at the end of a sentence. It seems more likely to me that they were viewed as anti-Muslim for understandable (if debatably correct) reasons and that this was intentional. 2) Relying on that one article to articulate the argument you want to address is unfair. I don't think CH was a collection of bad people or that what happened to them was remotely justifiable, I just don't think that anything they did was particularly productive or brave. 3) Dying does not make you a hero and it is not an insult to say that a dead person is not a hero. They were victims who suffered tragic and senseless deaths, but nothing they did was particularly heroic or praiseworthy. That's why their deaths were tragic: because they died for doing unremarkable things that really shouldn't have been taken that seriously. &gt;Islam has no special place. It should receive the same level of parody, criticism, satire, and insults that every other religion and ideology has - if not more so given it's followers reluctance to accept this. On the other hand, delivering that criticism/insult/parody is not that impressive when you do that in a country that guarantees free speech and not so admirable when done in a manner deliberately meant to offend and disrespect beliefs when it doesn't do anything productive. I'm not very impressed by people who stand up for free speech by actively seeking out the most offensive thing they can find and pushing that button again and again in the hope that the person they offend will just stop being offended. It's a fundamentally alienating and unproductive means of debate. You should be allowed to do it, I just don't necessarily respect anyone who does it.'.

So let's be really clear: if you were in, you were in the **Reserves** or the **National Guard**. You weren't in the active duty Army, so your viewon this will be more than a little skewed by a particular, abnormal perspective. That's an important distinction that you should be voicing up front, both for clarity and integrity's sake. From what I gather you joined the NG/R to pay for school, and I'll level with you: I think what you did was pretty selfish. *But*, it was no more selfish than a free college education would have been had you done nothing for it. You served your strategic purpose insofar as you were needed, and you got what the contract said you would get. Same thing as any employment contract anywhere else. Good for you. You never established the causal chain from any of these problems to the responsibility of individual military members. To describe membership in something as immoral, you need to explain why being a member makes you responsible for the problems in question. Did you make budget decisions? I know I didn't. Did you make strategic decisions? I know I didn't. So by what reasoning are we responsible for events and decisions beyond our control? In philosophical terms, you have failed to show how your premises imply the conclusion in your title. 1) Your budget numbers are wrong. The Federal budget for 2015 was a little over $3 trillion dollars, $608 billion is about 20% of that.

"The argument: 'While your intention is good - you want to make it clear that terrorism or mass killing ineffective as means of communicative violence - you're not accounting for the negative consequences of such a policy. 1) You create a counter-narrative of deception that diminishes the credibility of the government and media, and lends a degree of authenticity and validity to terrorist motives. People would say that the government and media were lying to them, and they'd be right. They would distrust both because, if they can lie about that, they can lie about anything. Nothing the media or government said could be trusted, and that would include those things said about terrorism in the first place. That in turn would produce an atmosphere where marginal media sources would find and publicize the actual motives for attacks, and they would have a veneer of validity because they were true and the government had tried to hide them. That increases the likelihood that someone will believe their motives are valid - why would the government hide them if they didn't have some element of threatening truth? 2) You inadvertently harm other groups. I'm talking about this: &gt;Tell the world that the guy who shot up a gay club was in fact not a terrorist, but an extremely frustrated closet Christian gay who could not figure out how to live anymore.

"The argument: '1) There are those who believe circumcising a newborn is morally wrong and that's a pretty strong Jewish tradition. The transitive property doesn't apply; condemning circumcision is not anti-semitism. It also stands to reason that others would view circumcision as barbaric. Take away the religious context, and you're essentially mutilating the sex organ of a baby. The ONLY reason anyone did that in the first place (and kept doing it) was religion. If someone doesn't subscribe to that religion, circumcision can look a lot like pointless mutilation. The main takeaway though, is that this in no way says anything about the intrinsic value of Judaism or the Jewish people. It says people care about babies and have differing views. 2) Frankly, this portion of your argument is a bit absurd. Criticizing Israeli policy doesn't make you an anti-Semite any more than criticizing the NSA or the Patriot Act make me anti-Americans (or anti-America, for that matter). I'm not going to get into it here, but suffice to say there are many legitimate grounds for criticism in Israeli policy. The US has actually blocked numerous UN resolutions condemning Israel's actions; I tend to think that means there are legitimate bones of contention. Last thing: conflating disagreement with Israel and anti-Semitism is *at best* a benign misunderstanding at work. When that isn't the case, it is often used as a tactic to bully those who criticize Israel by claiming they are anti-Semites and comparing them to Nazis. That tactic is underhanded, insulting to its object and generally offensive.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'What your *actual* view seems to be (as opposed to what you put in the title) is that the people we characterize as fundamentalists have a more correct interpretation than those we characterize as moderates. Those are two distinct positions: the one in your title presumes that there is an identifiable, objectively correct, literal interpretation that fundamentalists are more close to; the one you actually hold is that a fundamentalist interpretation is more plausible to you than a moderate one. If your actual view was what you put in the title, it should be enough to say that every word spoken, written or signed in the history of communication has been subject to interpretation and that words written thousands of years ago in different languages and in entirely different contexts can only be understood through interpretation. Applying lessons from those texts to modern issues *unequivocally requires* a great deal of interpretation; you're applying those lessons to issues involving objects and concepts for which those languages *didn't even have words*. (For instance, how would an ancient scribe write that the Earth was 15 billion years old when he had no words to either say or conceptualize what a ""billion"" was? Should we fault him for not including that?) So there is no proper literal interpretation that you can refer to because there really is no way to apply anything without interpreting it to fit a modern context. There's no getting around that. The WBC is interpreting just as much as any moderate; except WBC doesn't try to extrapolate a philosophical meaning that they then apply to their lives, they just try to find whatever situation in the Bible that they think is similar to their current circumstance and apply away. So instead of trying to figure out the purpose of Jesus' message and the effect it was meant to have, they think ""there's gays now, and God got mad at some gays in Leviticus so...God Hates Fags!"" A moderate Christian might instead look at that same passage and think ""well that doesn't jive with the things Jesus said.""

Persuant to 1) It's clear that your concern here is that /r/coontown could be used to recruit or propagate racist points of view and this is obviously a real possibility. Given free reign, a sufficiently persuasive user from there could come in to CMV, convince people that there views were correct and recruit an impressionable new racist. They could funnel all sorts of folks to their sub and recruit all sorts of alienated young white people to their cause. Of course, their success in doing so would depend on the inability of anybody else in the area to articulate a better and more persuasive argument. That really cuts to the heart of why banning any sort of ""hate speech"" is ultimately a bad idea: you abandon the ideological field and claim victory even though the other side is still strong and far from defeated. This has three major consequences: the arguments against racist points of view are no longer articulated, the arguments in favor of racism become mysterious and powerful and there is the *subtle* implication that you don't actually have a good argument against racism. What that all means is that banning the speech leaves you unable to confront or inoculate against ideas that will always have an appeal to the right people at the right time. There will always be alienated, angry young men looking for a fringe culture or ideology to find an identity; often they deliberately try to find the most dangerous and mysterious culture they can. If you keep those young men from seeing honest discourse between racists and non-racists, you risk having them reject the anti-racist platitudes they were taught in favor of the novel, dangerous and apparently flawless racist arguments.

You'll note that when the officer ""calms"" the dog he does so by reaching a hand toward its face. (This is a bad idea.) You'll also note that the officer had his gun out the last time he moved towards the dog. The dog jumped up, but didn't bite. It jumped off him and back to the ground. The officer then backed away and shot a dog that wasn't attacking him. &gt;Considering that there were people all over the place, causing both a safety hazard and a public relations problem, it might've been a better idea to pull out pepper spray, mace, a baton or try to get a hold of the damn lead...basically anything but shooting a dog in front of half the neighborhood. The most important point regarding the dog (arresting someone who irritates you is a separate issue) is that it wasn't attacking. Dogs are what they're conditioned to be. A dog develops violent tendencies in harsh, usually abusive environments. It's also very difficult for them to switch that aggression ""off"" once it's switched ""on"". My point there is that if this dog was vicious and ready to attack, it would've done so immediately and with conviction. It didn't so it probably wasn't going to.'.

It's also far cheaper to build and manufacture equipment and supplies in Russia, and costs less to pay and provide for troops. &gt;I anything, you could say that the US is one of NATOs more burdensome members, because they drain other members military resources by dragging them into conflicts they would normally not be involved in.

"The argument: 'Historically speaking, the deadliest point in a battle is in the retreat. When you hear stories of ancient battles with lopsided casualties, it's tempting to imagine that one side were better warriors and the others were weaklings, but the truth is that a retreat leaves you vulnerable to the full force of an enemy that doesn't have to worry half as much about your fighting back. Empires can fall in one undisciplined retreat. Washington managed a truly impressive number of well-managed, disciplined retreats that kept his army in the field and the British in pursuit. Was he a brilliant offensive strategist? No, his strategies were overly complicated and relied on drilled European-style regulars he just didn't have. Did he have to be a great offensive strategist? No. All he had to do was exhaust the British and keep them deployed so long that the country became more trouble to keep than it was worth. You speak of British incompetence, but none of that would have happened unless those British armies had been in the field chasing the likes of Washington. Washington kept men from deserting, handled logistics when Congress dropped the ball (they basically told him to steal from locals, he knew better). His accomplishment was in taking a bunch of men who weren't soldiers, turning them into a nominally functional army dangerous enough to demand attention and keep them from deserting long enough to complete the job. He also won quite a few decisive victories, including the endgame at Yorktown. Given what he had to work with, what else would you hope for? Could there have been a general who would've turned those same men into an army capable of beating the British consistently in the open field? It that person had existed, he would have made Napoleon look like a nerd playing Starcraft. Calibrate your expectations to what was possible. &gt;Washington was only elected President because he was the closest thing any Americans had come to see as a leader. He also refused much more power, including repeated offers of absolute executive authority for life. Generally speaking, we view that as a noble thing. &gt; By the end of his presidency people began to say his administration was ""corrupt"" and served only the rich and powerful landowners.

"The argument: '&gt;What they fail to ask themselves is “if there is a God would he not be focusing his attention on bigger problems like starving children”? Or is it that those stupid children are not smart enough to simply ask God to put a stop to their misery? Ok...so this is not a question so much as your veiled opinion in the form of an absurd question nobody applies to any situation. My girlfriend asked me to do the dishes last night, is she selfish because she distracted me from all the work for starving children I wasn't doing? What you're ultimately saying is that anyone who believes in a benevolent God (I do, BTW) is actually selfish because the [Problem of Evil](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil). &gt;It is inherently true that in order to maintain this attitude religious people must simply overlook the problems of others, they must think that those who suffer are less than human. They must either minimise the suffering of others by minimising their humanness (such as has been explicitly done with Jews and Black people in the past), or they must think that their misery is deserved. There is the third option: they accept that they don't know why those things happen. Being religious doesn't all of a sudden grant you the facility to explain why everything in the world is the way it is in minute detail; I'm often shocked at how much suffering God permits in the world. I wonder about the nature of the God that allows that and the nature of the world and the rules of a world that would accept both a a loving, omnipotent God and that kind of suffering. I believe that God cares individually about every person on the planet. I think that everyone has a personal relationship with God, whether they acknowledge it or not. I see no problem in asking God for help with anything because I'm not drawing on a finite labor pool that could be used for more important ends; I'm bringing my problems and frustrations to God because I need help from a pool of infinite help. I have no solid idea as to why God permits bad things to happen to good people; the best I have are notions of how the world might work.

"The argument: 'Fireworks are nowhere close to as deadly as a gun. I could probably shoot a relatively powerful firework directly at your chest and it would just give you a nasty burn (assuming I actually hit you at all). That's not quite as bad as a sucking chest wound that *will* kill you if you aren't attended to by a doctor *quickly*. &gt;The only way for the law to work is if it is administered fairly with no exceptions. Not true. 1. There is no law in the history of humanity that has been enforced with no exceptions. Somebody is always able to do something illegal and get away with it, but that in no way invalidates the idea that the law ought to exist. 2. There is no reason there should never be circumstantial exceptions to rigorous laws. Society may very well benefit from the suspension of a law that makes sense in general, but is annoyingly restrictive during specific times. So while lighting off fireworks on a random Tuesday isn't cool, it's an American tradition that is awesome and should be allowed on the 4th of July. 3. Laws can be overly broad, yet under-enforced when the intent is to calm or limit the behavior instead of absolutely preventing it. On US military bases, it is illegal to have sexual intercourse in government buildings; to include enlisted bachelor housing. Do you think that stops many people from bringing women back to the barracks? Do you think those who gave the order intended for them to stop? Nope! The intent was to make the activity more risky so that those who did it would behave themselves. So light off your fireworks, but if you do it wrong we can at least charge you with using fireworks.'.

You point to evidence of intelligence or consciousness and equate that to the kind of mental life that humans have. If that were objectively true, your view would be unassailably correct. I don't see it that way. I look at animals and I see that when we stop anthropomorphizing their behavior, they actually aren't very impressive as thinkers. They can think and feel pain, but their thoughts do not equal a human's. We have no evidence of dolphin poetry, squirrel religion, chimp music or whale science. In the larger view, animals eat each other in the wild all the time. We don't bother with shark or wolf ethics; we accept that they kill to live. We accept it when omnivorous creatures kill when they theoretically don't have to.

Your failure to accept those truths can be frustrating and exasperating, and might arouse suspicion or wariness. Thomas Aquinas said something like: hate is willing ill towards another. A person who hates you wants you to suffer for its own sake - not in the way that someone who cares you might hope that you learn a painful lesson, they just want you to feel pain of some kind because they derive joy from your suffering. I'd venture a guess that few religious people actually want that. The worst among them probably do, some others probably wouldn't mind a penny-in-the-light-socket moment, and the rest ignore you or don't care. For my part, I don't hate you.

Third, that thing looks fluffy, not scaly.

They may influence the way voters think, but they don't take anyone's vote away. As such, though what they did was an affront to the US, they can plausibly deny responsibility and we can't point to any election law that was actually broken. Interference in actual machines would more than likely be discovered, even if it couldn't be confirmed that Russia was responsible. That would probably result in a revote in the affected area, and it would be a wasted effort to interfere, be discovered, and lose the benefit of interfering in a more closely scrutinized vote. If it were discovered that Russia were responsible for that interference, that would be a legitimate *casus belli*.

In interpersonal interactions, it means that you cannot necessarily accept my conveyed knowledge of truth unless I can provide evidence of some kind (be it trusted anecdotal or empirical). The difficulty is that the falsifiability standard is a heuristic that we use for practical application and solipsism-avoidance; it has no intrinsic bearing on what we can actually know. I can know something that is unfalsfiable to you, and I'm not being arrogant at all if what I say I know is actually true. It seems that you may equate ""know"" only to claims that are falsifiable, but that isn't the apparent case. If you described knowing what is not falsifiable as belief, it only becomes arrogant if the belief and falsifiable knowledge don't carry the same weight in an individual person's mind. If my belief in God is de facto knowledge (in that I ""know"" it to be true despite my inability to prove it), then differentiating between belief and knowledge is a purely semantic distinction. If I portray a belief I don't hold in the same esteem as empirical knowledge, yet portray that belief as knowledge, then I'm being arrogant. I'd also point out that we all indulge in this belief/knowledge blending all the time. We trust the claims of others that we make no attempt to falsify as truth that we claim to know.

"The argument: 'In my opinion, this conflict arises from a failure to differentiate between contextual connotations of the word ""responsible"". What the word itself boils down to is the assumption of agency; if you have control over something, you are responsible for it in some sense. You could then break that down into two types of responsibilities: obligatory and elective. Obligatory responsibilities are those that are inherently yours. They're matters in which you do or should have the primary force of agency. Paying your bills, eating, breathing, drinking...all of these could be considered obligatory responsibilities. To be irresponsible in this sense is to neglect what you *need* to have control over, because failing to take that control will inherently result in negative consequences. Elective responsibilities are those that you take on to gain more control of your life. You might argue that the taking on of these responsibilities signifies a more mature person, but they are different from the obligatory responsibilities in that they often deal with your agency contending with that of others. Locking your doors at night, keeping valuables out of sight in your car, carrying a gun, not losing track of your drink at a frat party...all of these could be considered elective responsibilities. Being irresponsible in this sense means to neglect what would be *prudent* for you to have control over, because failing to take that control leaves you subject to the agency of others. When people conflate these two types of responsibility, there's a problem. Being irresponsible in the obligatory case is to invite entirely predictable consequences; you are accountable for failure to fulfill your obligatory responsibilities. Being irresponsible in the elective case only puts you at risk. You are not accountable for the actions of others that take advantage of your irresponsibility. We might say you were being irresponsible if you left a MacBook Air in plain view in Baltimore, but that doesn't mean you're accountable for its theft. So while a woman at a frat party who takes drinks from random strangers may be acting irresponsibly, her agency does not determine her rape later that night.

"The argument: '&gt;There is no reason that the Democratic Party should not be maintaining a majority presence in government. Yet here we are. Democrats have been humiliated and delegitimized at every level of government. Yeah there is: your ground game is hot garbage. The Democratic effort to win local races has been more or less pathetic since they lost the majority. Beyond that, your polls tell you what people want in very general terms. They don't tell you who's going to vote, and they don't tell you the cost-benefit analysis that goes on in a voter's head when they're trying to determine the things they want, but can't have. I would *like* universal healthcare. I also realize that implementing it right now (under President Sanders) would be insane. Now, to my broader argument: 1) This won't happen because Democrats have all the organization of a drum circle at Woodstock. You aren't directed by grass-roots leaders and your community and local presence is phenomenally weak. All of the people who might be suited to that work are busy staging pointless demonstrations or leading polarizing movements like BLM. Many more are just shrugging into apathy because the party is so disorganized and fractious. You're complaining about the leaders who've kept your party coherent while you mostly ignore it outside of Presidential elections. 2) Democrats are politically lazy. They voted for Barack Obama twice, patted themselves on the back, and ignored Congressional elections. Do you really think President Sanders would've changed much? Not really - I mean, we wouldn't have had the same drama as we have with Trump, but they both would've been limited by the power restrictions on the executive branch. Sanders would've accomplished nothing at all until he gained control of Congress - and his platform was so extreme that even that probably wouldn't have been enough. You need to win local seats and seats in Congress. God-Emperor Bernie wasn't going to do it on his own, and the folks who act like he was some great loss don't understand what a minor role he would've had in making policy.

Violence and war are omnipresent throughout human history and (in my view) were a far more common result of conflict the further back in history you go. To put it another way: Caesar murdered, raped an pillaged his way across large swathes of Europe and was rewarded with incredible power. His death was a function of Rome's system of government, not the actions of his that brutalized the ""barbarians."" The Mongols, the Vikings, the Goths, the Romans, the British, the Americans...you can find countless points in history where (from one reasonable point of view) the bad guys cut the Gordian Knot by just bashing their enemy over the head with a rock and enjoying the victory. It depends on what you think a story needs to be. Does it need to teach a moral? Maybe. Does it need to be honest? I'd say the better stories are.

And blaming the US for China, India, or Russia's growing contribution to carbon emissions? That just doesn't logically follow. You want to blame the US for the Middle East? Why do so few point to the people who drew arbitrary borders throughout the middle east, declared intent to support a Jewish homeland in Palestine, installed favorable rulers in multiple countries irrespective of local approval *and then just left?* Because that's pretty much what Britain did.

"The argument: 'Someone said my name... Ex-military here, and I think you've got this a bit twisted. Some of the harshest critics of police militarization and excessive force are former members of the military. We're in a position to do that because many of us received escalation force training specifically designed to prevent unlawful killing, even in exceedingly tense and hostile environments. Those of us who deployed often spent a great deal of time following rules of engagement that required us to clearly establish that someone intended to harm us before employing lethal force. (Hostile act + hostile intent = shoot). There was an understanding that even if a shooting made sense to you in the moment, CNN would crucify you given the chance and your command wouldn't back you unless your reasoning was airtight. So even in an atmosphere where the axiom ""better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6"" was popular, unlawful shootings were rare even in a counterinsurgency campaign where the enemy did their best to look like the average person. So for example, any idiot could tell you that reaching for a belt is not enough to get you shot. Holding a gun is not enough to get you shot. Getting in an unarmed physical altercation with me is not necessarily enough to get you shot. Telling me you're going to shoot me with the gun you have in your hands is *borderline*. Even today that level of restraint seems nonsensical on its face, but it generally works. Those deeply engrained EOF procedures kept us on our toes and kept us from killing anyone who wasn't either a bad guy or profoundly, impressively stupid. The problem I see with regard to police policy is a generally aggressive set of EOF procedures, not necessarily the personnel implementing them. Organizational mentality is established by training and too much police training is predicated on standing your ground and escalating force as criteria are met (a military mindset, to be sure) rather than finding the most pragmatic path to de-escalation (which ought to be the police mindset).

"The argument: '&gt;The MKKK, unlike their predecessors, are largely nonviolent. The only reason they aren't the old Klan is that the FBI bitch-slapped them into submission. Before that, they were homicidal terrorists. The change wasn't an ethical decision, it was a cowed response to a savage beating. Now, you say that people are trying to inhibit higher reasoning by making an association between the ""MKKK"" and the OKKK. One problem: *They coulda picked a different name.* Nobody is inhibiting anything, the modern Klan chooses to retain the name of a racist terrorist group that used to murder black people for looking at white women the wrong way - and sometimes just because it was Thursday and people were bored. And it's not like that was their side gig while focusing on puppy orphanages; terrorist intimidation of blacks was their reason for existing. The modern fuckheads keep a name they should discard. They want that association, so give it to them. They don't get a pass because they've managed to not do the things that got them eviscerated a few decades ago. They can condemn and disavow violence until they're blue in the face; they choose to retain a name synonymous with racist violence and support implicitly violent policies. The problems with Trump and the Klan are twofold: 1) Trump was too unprincipled to reject the endorsement outright. When you know who the Klan is and you find out they endorse you, you reject that endorsement because they're racist wannabe terrorists.

But they're able to do that because people aren't clear about what one another is even talking about, much less what to do next. The bottom line is this: People on the left are more likely to think in terms of the structural: trends and institutions. People on the right are more likely to think in terms of the individual: personal choice. It's progressives' responsibility to explain how those relate to each other when they talk about things like racism.

"The argument: '""Credibility"" is one of many factors to consider when making a narrative set in the past, and honestly, it doesn't strike me as a particularly important one. Much more important to me is the artistic statement or theme. Having a black Nazi can cause a modern observer to reflect on historical racial dynamics in a particular way that wouldn't be possible otherwise (I know nothing about CoD in particular, but this could be an element). For games, there's also the idea of immersion, which is distinct from suspension of disbelief. Having an avatar that resembles oneself increases a feeling of presence and engagement in a game, so giving black players that option would increase their enjoyment of the game. The other issue is that people's lay-theories about past social events can be wildly wrong. I don't know about black nazis, but there were black slave-owners in the American south. If you had a game with that element, people might decry it as unbelievable, even though it was true. People's blanket heuristics about ""what it was like in the past!"" shouldn't necessarily be trusted. Honestly, though, it doesn't really seem like you find the presence of black nazis distracting per se; rather, you find the perceived intentions of the game-makers to fulfill a quota distracting.

"The argument: 'Creative genius doesn't work as an objective measure of value for a few reasons. First, it forces us to restrict our definition of art. Nothing produced by nature or chance, for example, can be said to have value as art since mindless forces lack the prerequisites for creative genius. Then there's the problem that creative genius is not an inherent property of the art itself. Any infinite but random string of letters, for example, will contain, somewhere in it, all of the great works of literature, but without any creative genius involved. Same goes for the classic thousand monkeys with a thousand typewriters scenario. If we take the greatest work of art by the most creative genius hypothetically possible and objectively analyze it alongside the exact same work of art created by a random number generator, even the most objective possible intelligence will not find a single atom (or any empirical unit) of such a thing as creative genius present in one but absent in the other.'.

A Thousand Suns was different and atmospheric, but it still gave every member of the band a chance to shine. Chester sounds great as always, but he only gets to show off a fraction of his range. Mike only gets one rap verse and it's nothing extraordinary compared to his rapping on Living Things or A Thousand Suns. And other than Joe, the rest of the band is barely there on at least half if not most of the album. That was never a problem with the band before. Even on their primarily electronic stuff, you still had memorable, driving instrumental tracks. On the other hand, could you tell me from memory what the instrumental track to Heavy, Halfway Right, or Sorry For Now sounds like? Go back one album to The Hunting Party and it's clear you're getting the full Linkin Park experience.

Your tires, when worn down. However, a computer in a car has something going for it: maintenance. You get your car into the shop fairly often (2-5 times a year on average for most people), and so when the car is self-driving, it can take itself in for maintenance (hell, it can do this when you're at work, and then can bring itself back or, if there is a big problem, a replacement can drive out to you) to make sure that it doesn't crash on you. &gt;And how would these self driving cars get to the destination?

The best way I've seen this described is that in Season 2 you're watching Walter White, mild-mannered husband and teacher pretending to be the ruthless drug lord Heisenberg, and by Season 5 you're watching the ruthless drug lord Heisenberg pretend to be mild-mannered husband and teacher Walter White. To say there aren't externalities that push him there would be a lie, but the fact is that he became the mask.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

Having a brain-map that believes that you should have phenotypical qualities of the opposite gender (which is what transgender is; transsexual is the dividing line where a transgendered individual goes for reconstructive surgery.) has no inherent belief of the superiority of the gender they are transitioning towards. I'm a cisgendered male, and I certainly don't think that my penis makes me objectively superior to females, and this would have to be true for your premise to be true, since cis/trans are just opposite ends of the ""my body is supposed to be X"" spectrum of our brain's maps of our body. A way that helped me wrap my head around this (because I seriously had trouble with it) was hearing that it's neurologically similar to how phantom limb syndrome works: if you have to amputate an arm, your brain will still ""feel"" itches and whatnot on the arm that isn't there anymore, because your brain's map of your body includes that hand. Similarly, a transman's body map, for whatever reason, contains broad shoulders, facial hair, and sometimes a penis; It's not fully understood yet what exactly is causing the brain map to not match the body (as far as I know), but just because there's a spectrum going from completely cis to some hormone therapy helps to completely transitioning doesn't make these two things inherently different, and it certainly doesn't make a trans individual a bigot.'.

"The argument: 'The sorts of people who insist on using the term ""Romantic love"" are the sorts of people who have problems with the idea of polyamory because they have to codify everything into groups. I am very well aware of the problem of having to put everything into a neat container, after all I program computers; but that doesn't work as well for human emotions. If you're not familiar with the ""map and territory"" model of thinking, here's the basic rundown as I understand it: The territory of a known phenomenon is set, and our map of it is our best understanding; problems occur when the map isn't accurate to the territory. That said, part of my map of love is that it operates off of positive feedback loops; you love someone who loves you, and their love makes you happy so you love more. That's the basic pattern, until outside interference breaks the loop. Normally, it's life. Now, where most people get lost is that their map doesn't bother to take into account that there are more than 2 people in the grand system of life; kind of like the old joke where a physicist is trying to figure out why a cow is depressed and he starts with ""first we'll model the cow as a perfect sphere..."" it doesn't take into account crucial external variables that radically alter the output of the equation. The problem it runs into is that it assumes that love is zero-sum; that when you love someone else you automatically love the other person less. And that's just not true. Take children, for instance: when you have a child, you love them. When you have a second child, you love the second child as well. Do you love the first child less? Most people with children would say ""Hell no!"" and there's your answer. Romantic love functions the same way, because romantic love is essentially familial love but also you want sex or some form of physical intimacy (usually; nothing against asexuals, but I'm generalizing here) that you don't want with family. All that said, I don't think that all monogamous people believe that in order to love, you must be selfish; I think that for the majority of them, it isn't a conscious decision, but a tacit",[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],7.0,True,Gaming,Self-direction: action

Instead, boys reported that talking about problems would make them feel “weird” and like they were “wasting time.” Men don't talk about their feelings because they feel it would be useless, not because they are afraid of social stigma. This is very much a feminist way to think about things. You identify a problem that women have- women like to hear about men's emotions, then avoid talking to men and asking them about it, and then you have a solution that says men should be more like women. Not that, in my experience, there has been any serious feminist effort to support emotional males. I've often seen them mock emotional males for complaining when they are part of the patriarchy. A kind attempt to help men asks the men what they need and tries to supply it, it doesn't ask women what they want and avoids supplying it because it's too much effort. Point 2 is a rather weak point as it is. It says ""If we do stuff for women, sometime in the future maybe men will be better off"". With rape, feminists have a really atrocious record on this. A lot don't recognize f on m rape as rape, feminists have tried to exclude f on m rape from academic studies, and feminists have very heavily stigmatized men as rapists, much more than in the past.

"The argument: 'That's not even remotely close to their actual reason for existence. https://home.nra.org/about-the-nra/ &gt;Dismayed by the lack of marksmanship shown by their troops, Union veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis,"" according to a magazine editorial written by Church. &gt;Meanwhile, the NRA continued its commitment to training, education and marksmanship. During World War II, the association offered its ranges to the government, developed training materials, encouraged members to serve as plant and home guard members, and developed training materials for industrial security. NRA members even reloaded ammunition for those guarding war plants. Incidentally, the NRA's call to help arm Britain in 1940 resulted in the collection of more than 7,000 firearms for Britain's defense against potential invasion by Germany (Britain had virtually disarmed itself with a series of gun-control laws enacted between World War I and World War II). &gt;After the war, the NRA concentrated its efforts on another much-needed arena for education and training: the hunting community. In 1949, the NRA, in conjunction with the state of New York, established the first hunter education program. Hunter Education courses are now taught by state fish and game departments across the country and Canada and have helped make hunting one of the safest sports in existence. Due to increasing interest in hunting, NRA launched a new magazine in 1973, The American Hunter, dedicated solely to hunting issues year-round. NRA continues its leadership role in hunting today with the Youth Hunter Education Challenge (YHEC), a program that allows youngsters to build on the skills they learned in basic hunter education courses. YHECs are now held in 43 states and three Canadian provinces, involving an estimated 40,000 young hunters. Their goal is to increase marksmanship with a primary purpose being strengthening the government militaries, a secondary purpose being strengthening hunters. They don't have a purpose of stopping the military from conquering the land. '.

"The argument: '&gt;I believe that there is no inherent right to not work on holidays That seems entirely reasonable, it's arguable if there are any inherent rights anyway. &gt;and that employees **should** work as required. So you're saying they have an inherent obligation to work to your whims? Few people are obliged to work. Bar a small number of exceptions, like the military, you're not. That's because if you're obliged to work then that's slavery. People have the freedom to select where they work, and often to set their working hours to some degree. Many like to spend time with their families on holidays, and the government, having recognized this e.g. http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ The universal human right's document &gt;Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay. And so many holidays are enshrined in law and are officially and legally a right. Your desire to shop on holidays isn't more important than their desire to be with their families and relax. There's no right to shop whenever you want human right. Rightfully so, because slavery is bad. Of course, many shops pay people a large extra bonus to work on holidays and let them voluntarily work. So you can do some shopping.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'When people commit to principles that's normally because they have evaluated the evidence and believe that being close minded is a better way to adapt to different situations than being open minded. If you are open minded it's easy to sway you to make a bad decision. Let's take the terrorist example. Let's assume that if you negotiate with terrorists in month A then in month B then the terrorists will take twice as many hostages. So it is bad. If you are open minded then you might convince yourself that this time it is ok. And do the same the next month, the next month. You'll be a lot worse off by the end of the year. If you are close minded then you'll have far less incidents and you'll have a generally better society.

This risk is increased if you are a high value partner- a lot of contraception is deliberately used poorly with the hope of impregnation.

Many people also have strong values which say it is wrong to hurt your partner and cheat on them, and the emotional pain of cheating will make them want to avoid it. It is rational to avoid pain.

"The argument: 'This has been attempted often, with the good men's project say. Tom Matlack, a fervent feminist, wanted a place for men to have a voice in a polite and feminist friendly way. He started a website, the good men's project. http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/why-being-a-good-man-is-not-a-feminist-issue/ &gt;That’s why it saddened me to engage in such non-productive debates with the likes of Hugo Schwyzer, Amanda Marcotte, and Roseanne Barr who all attacked me for saying that being a dude is a good thing. And faced heavy criticism and hate from the feminist movement for saying that being male isn't bad. &gt;Perhaps even more significant than my fist fights with feminism over manhood has been the steady stream of highly trafficked pieces on our site about the female view of men, from gas lighting (one of our most popular pieces ever—“Why Women Are Not Crazy”) to the constant drum beat of posts in which manhood is viewed in the context of gender theory. Stuff like, “On Women’s Rights: Yeah, Yeah. Blah, Blah. Whatever.” And “A Rant.” And “Five Ways Feminism Helps Men.” And a site dominated by female voices. That's generally what I've seen when feminists have tried to address men's rights issues. Feminists have been extraordinarily hostile to any notion that men are good, and have been extraordinarily hostile to the idea of men having a safe space to speak about their feelings. The predictable result is that men I've talked to have showed a great deal of hostility and annoyance at that site. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey Erin Pizzey, an influential feminist. She ran one of the first domestic violence centers. When doing so she discovered that many men needed help and women were violent and tried to help them.

Over 50% of the world's population worships the abrahamic god, most of the rest are unaffiliated, which due to china's forced communist religion changing generally means worshiping Xi Jinping, or worship Hindu gods which is a religion mostly confined to a single country.

If your issue is that the world is complex, well yeah, it is, but people still make choices. Most of the choices are non choices. Sure you can worship Korean Shamanism, the belief that there are various spirits in Korea who can do nice things for you, but that's not a serious choice for most people, or Tenrikyo, a belief that the 19th century japanese woman Nakayama Miki was the shrine of god, but again, not",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.0,False,Other,"Power: dominance,Face,Security: personal,Conformity: interpersonal"

"The argument: 'This comes from mistakenly viewing communism or socialism as something based on sharing, or that people had some great inability to follow rules which made communism fail. Communism and Marxism was never really about sharing or caring or freedom or creativity. It was about Marx seeing a society that was wrong and thinking that he and others with the same ideology as him could fix it by controlling everything. Communists like himself ""have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole."" and are inherently good willed and helpful unlike. He then wanted monopoly control over communication, the banks, he wanted to abolish marriage and enact child labour, lots of stuff. And communist countries did function. True, people got pretty drunk on the job, true, the labour was pretty shoddy, but communists countries did get a lot done. https://i.imgur.com/MdUbfEf.png When they industrialized and advanced their science their life expectancy went up, their GPD went up. Communism is a fairly normal technological authoritatian style dictatorship. Science makes it fairly easy to care for people and people do respond reasonably well to being told what to do. It had trade schools to train people for jobs and they did those jobs well enough to please their superiors or they got punished. Communism worked reasonably as expected. The communists got in power, they carried out their various whims with social policy, and the population was forced to work by schooling systems and the police. Due to their military urges Russia overreached somewhat, and lost a lot of money competing with the far more advanced America and trying to hold together their ethnically diverse empire, but that wasn't really much to do with selfishness. Marx never really talked that much about a utopia. He had a much more immediate plan which worked as intended.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'I think it's important to make a strong distinction between why people chose to engage in polyamory. Some people chose to do it because they like having sex with lots of people. Someone who might be a cheater in another relationship might pressure their partner to engage in it, perhaps with the aid of drugs. Both people would have intense jealousy when the other cheats and the relationship won't work well. Some do it because it's a part of their culture and they feel it's expected. Think people like hippies, religious people who feel it's obliged, things like that. They may have more discipline, but they still often find it is unsuited to them. These two groups are likely the ones who you mean. They are utterly unsuited to the lifestyle and so they face immense issues when they try it, and their relationship breaks apart. Many describe being polyamorous as something like a sexuality. Imagine someone straight trying to force themselves to be homosexual (political lesbians, prison gay) and imagine how that would go. Some people do it because they don't feel jealousy but they enjoy the feeling of fresh love and passion. They have enough discipline to avoid doing things that break up their relationship. Those people are suited to polyamory. You really shouldn't do it because it's a trend in popular culture, any more than you should become gay because it's in within popular culture.

They expected to find the same thing as you said, that Donald Trump would sound worse as a woman, that his words would be unacceptable, that a bias against women would doom him. What did they find? &gt;We heard a lot of “now I understand how this happened”—meaning how Trump won the election. People got upset. There was a guy two rows in front of me who was literally holding his head in his hands, and the person with him was rubbing his back. The simplicity of Trump’s message became easier for people to hear when it was coming from a woman—that was a theme. One person said, “I’m just so struck by how precise Trump’s technique is.” Another—a musical theater composer, actually—said that Trump created “hummable lyrics,” while Clinton talked a lot, and everything she was was true and factual, but there was no “hook” to it. Another theme was about not liking either candidate—you know, “I wouldn’t vote for either one.” Someone said that Jonathan Gordon [the male Hillary Clinton] was “really punchable” because of all the smiling. And a lot of people were just very surprised by the way it upended their expectations about what they thought they would feel or experience. There was someone who described Brenda King [the female Donald Trump] as his Jewish aunt who would take care of him, even though he might not like his aunt. Someone else described her as the middle school principal who you don’t like, but you know is doing good things for you. If they had been different genders Trump would have probably been even stronger. His strong charisma and personality was obvious to them, even more obvious from a woman.

"The argument: 'People who read comics and movies and such enjoy continuity and dislike when people change core concepts as it means they can't maintain a story as something continuous in their head. Even with reboots, people like the characters to stay somewhat the same. When there is some change in people's motivations or nature that continuity is broken. It is fiction yes, but much of the enjoyment of that fiction comes from immersing yourself in that world and pretending it's real. People have extensive debates about the nature of those fictional worlds. I am a tolkein fan and have been awarded deltas in this sub for my extensive interest in the nature of his fictional world and exactly what the author intended and meant. You find the stories mostly ridiculous, most fans enjoy immersion and don't see it as ridiculous. Fans tend to like that the rules of the fantasy world are consistent so they don't lose immersion. So when our favorite character changes a lot there is the same frustration. It isn't only with race. There was a lot of debate and controversy over Daniel Craig being a blonde James Bond. When Captain America decided that American citizens, tea party members, were his foe people got annoyed. So why is it shocking Thor being female? He can levitate a hammer, is super strong and durable, can summon lightning. Those are his powers. Not gender shifting. When he gender shifts it's not consistent with the past story and so it breaks immersion. With this particular situation, they're putting a new different character in, so everyone who liked the old Thor no longer gets to see the stuff they like which makes it worse. Edit. A personal example of a gender swap I am worried about. I read pact, a webfiction about magic and witchery. Spoiler alert. The main character, Blake, had bad stuff happen to him and I am worried that Rose, his female counterpart, will replace him. She has a very different personality and while some may enjoy her I personally hate her as a character and read the story for Blake's struggles.'.

"The argument: '1) is somewhat acceptable. It's fun dating people somewhat like you. Although there is the thing that some people are very good at switching from introverted to extroverted. You could slightly open up this category and still find someone who wasn't stressful to be for, who didn't involve you with friends. 2) is not a very good strategy. There are ways to find partners with a low rejection risk- befriend people before you date say. If you met someone who was enjoyable to be with (per the above introvert requirement) and who you found attractive you could enjoy being with her without much risk of rejection or bad socialization. Putting yourself out there doesn't always involve socialization or risk. 3) You are seriously limiting your partner pool with this. It might be good to expand your dating pool to non spiritual buddhists/jews. There's a lot of women who are of a religion for the social/philosophical benefits and who do believe in no gods and in the benefits of humanism. You could find someone with serious overlap who doesn't fit the categories you put out. 4) Quite possible given your age. 5) Slightly harder given your age, but very possible.

"The argument: 'Patriotism is one of a variety of group building ideas that binds communities together. It helps people work together for common goals- to make a football game, build a great building, writing a constitution for your country. Your essential issue is ""Patriotism says you should care more for your country people, not for people abroad"". I think a better question would be why should you care about anyone outside your immediate friend circle? Why should you care if anyone dies who you don't know? A lot of people are selfish like that. They don't care about anyone other than friends or family. Patriotism is a step up from that. It means that, while you're in a country, everyone around you is an 'us' not a 'them', not someone to be stigmatized. If patriotism disappeared people wouldn't suddenly start caring about people abroad. They'd just not care about anyone outside their immediate friend circle. They might support slave labor in China to make shoes instead. I agree that it would be good to think on a more global scale. Patriotism is a stepping stone to that. In the distant past, people only cared about their tribe- then as time went on they cared about their city, then their city state, then their country. Now people care about their coalition of nations. Patriotism should be expanded. I hope that as people become increasingly close with the expansion of the internet, everyone can be a citizen of the world and we can be patriotic to everyone.'.

And the Catholic Monarchs commanded him to ""endeavor to win over the natives,"" and ""treat them well, lovingly, and abstain from causing them injury."" and he told them in letters he wrote about how he was doing that, while in actuality he forbid them from being baptized so he could have a good supply of slaves, used them brutally as slave labour to support his exaggerated claims of rivers of gold, and was generally extremely brutal. He even sent slaves back to Spain to be sold to increase his profits. They were pardoned by royal decree and freed. On his second voyage Fonseca, a royal administrator, was sent along, and he refused to follow his commands and wishes. Natives were considered to be humans and potential converts to Christianity. The Catholic monarchs sponsoring him were extremely interested in them being treated well and converted to the correct faith. He went against their words and their man who sent along with him to be a brutal psychopath. He was well out of the norm of those around him, a brutal murderer in a land far away from royal authority, if not royal commands and people.

"The argument: 'Expert witnesses are commonly used in court cases. There are many standards to call them on, but one notable one is the Daubert standard. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard This requires a theory to be tested, peer reviewed, have high reliability, and to be generally accepted by the scientific community. It was widely recognized that the previous standard, the Frye standard, was insufficient. This sort of view has caused problems. One example of this is medical malpractice laws. Often new drugs have unintended side effects and the consensus view among scientists may be out of date. This happened in the past with Thalidomide. That was a drug that caused people to be born without limbs. The medical consensus was that the womb was impenetrable, and so scientists who presented studies showing otherwise were rejected from courts. It's also fairly well known for experts to duel in courts over the same studies. One might advance an odd perspective based on the same studies. Should they be accepted if it's not the majority view? So why advance these majority perspectives at all? Most fields are far less controversial than the frontiers of medical science, and there's a vast amount of evidence in them. &gt;saying things like ""the evidence for climate change is overwhelming"" or ""many scientific experiments have shown climate change is occurring"" or ""climate change can be easily demonstrated now in experiments"" are consistent with the nature of science, This isn't enough. As noted above, often in history scienists have dueled over the same studies. Evidence has to be interpreted. Knowing that the majority of scientists who are interpreting experiments believe that the studies point to some conclusion is useful information.

They initially tried very hard to get people to learn stuff, but when whatever learning method worked for them failed they got frustrated, rude, and shouty. A lot of people are not well suited to be teachers. This isn't really a sign of being a bad person. Many people, perhaps you included, might behave like Snape if made a teacher. This is more a sign of Dumbledore's abysmal hiring strategies. He hires people who are experts at the subject and are socially vulnerable (Snape, Hagrid, Sybill, Binns) but who have no teaching skill whatsoever. 2. Him being a death eater. He likely didn't kill anyone- when talking to Dumbledore he notes that he doesn't want to murder him as it would tear apart his soul, like Draco's, implying his soul was not torn. He was somewhat socialized to be a death eater. He was put in the villain house which produces mostly bad people, surrounded by other death eaters. He was repeatedly bullied by James and Sirius.

People frequently get ripped into for unreasonable standards of jealousy. &gt;If A sleeps with or does anything intimate with B, nothing has changed between A and me. A still has the same personality, we still have the same mutual interests and senses of humor, and A can still prioritize me over everyone else. Sex is notably different to casual fantasies. Sex tends to lead to emotional bonds due to hormones and inherently is a time expensive activity that takes a while. Sex as a practical matter often forces people to prioritize you lower. &gt;I want to feel uniquely special to my partner. I want to feel like only I can give a particular something to my partner or satisfy her particular needs, as she does for me. Ah. Long distance relationship? Emotionally distant person? You sound like someone who has been burnt. A lot of people are capable of having high maintenance relationships where you pay attention to others. Maybe you feel you were faultless in whatever relationship and therefore if people were like you then you could have a happy relationship? As a practical matter, lots of people are capable of making you happy with lots of attention and love and care, being a best friend and a lover. I severely doubt you were entirely blameless in whatever relationship, and picking someone like you isn't a reliable way to find a partner who gives you your needs. &gt;Sex is an intimate act to me and A is my intimate outlet in this stressful world, and it makes it more meaningful to me if we share that perspective.* You can find meaning in whatever you want, but while polyamorists have well known issues with intimacy that are tricky to solve monogamous people with sexual fantasies don't behave notably differently from monogamous people without sexual fantasies. They can make you feel special continually in a way that polyamorists who spend time with others can't although polyamorists can of course make people feel special in a very different way.

""If you say anything that hurts my feelings, I'll talk to my boss and ask them to fire you, and he likes me more than your ugly ass so I bet he'd do it."" If people were radically honest that wouldn't shield them from consequences. On your points. 1. Being close to someone is a neurological thing to do with brain chemicals. You can be close to someone based on nothing but their appearance or voice or smell. Honesty isn't required. 2. People have lots of hurtful feelings about people's sexuality, race, gender, religion, politics, appearance. Things that aren't really easy to change or fix. Having people repeatedly tell you that they hate looking at your face and your boss that you're ugly so they're not going to approve a pay rise you'd need for plastic surgery isn't really going to help you fix yourself. 3. There are reasons we don't say positive things about people too often. People often get crushes based on these things and often self delude, and often form annoying friendships. 4. If you call someone an asshole then they're more likely to punch you in the face. This isn't a resolution. &gt;Response: At first, people might find it difficult. Over time, I think people would get desensitized to blunt, sometimes harsh honesty that I'm proposing. It's not really happened yet.

Research studies show us that cows understand cause and effect, for instance cows have learnt that when they are thirsty that pushing a lever to operate a drinking fountain provides them with water and when they are hungry cows have learnt that pressing a button with their heads provides them with food. Cows, a common food animal, are highly intelligent and sentient. Vegetarians often have no issue eating meat, they simply have an issue eating meat from sentient beings.

In reality, ideas about masculinity and femininity are extremely common. Those who pick up books about masculinity are likely culturally or genetically closer to what people see as feminine. Asian guys, short guys, guys mostly raised by females. They've often faced heavy abuse by the culture at large for not being masculine enough. ""Eww, you're short, go away."" Relatively uncommon books like the sort you mentioned that have very little impact on culture at large aren't driving abuse.

Probably just a few, belonging to those people with whom you had a conversation, a confrontation, a collision. &gt;So particle physicists — the experimentalists who run the detectors and take the data, and the theorists like me who advise them — obsess and debate and argue about the trigger. It’s essential that its strategies and settings be chosen with care, and adjusted properly as the collision rate changes or new information becomes available. As the ultimate and irreversible filter, it’s also a potential cause of disappointment or even disaster, so opinions about it are strong and emotions run high. There is far more data than there is storage software for data. As such, most is dumped. That means it's necessary for theorists to predict where interesting information will likely be found.

A caning is swift and then over - prison is years of torture. A caning only punishes the offender; imprisonment collectively punishes his wife, children, employer, and friends. It tears up marriages, deprives children of their parents, ends working relationships, and makes the offender unable to find most jobs afterwards. It is far more likely to accidentally turn into a death sentence than a beating is. We need to deter certain crimes that do not need extensive rehabilitation and which cannot be properly deterred by monetary fines.

The surgeon has the right and obligation to ensure that *if* she decides to go ahead with surgery, she does so in the best possible way.

It obligates her to do it if you accede to her ordinary MO. That ordinary MO obviously cannot include things like ""you must sign over your first born"". It obviously must include things like ""I will follow standard medical practice"". Sending removed tissues to pathology is generally standard medical practice.

A great school will prepare its graduates to excel at all kinds of things, good and bad. Princeton is almost certainly in the top 10 schools given this. It may not be quite as prestigious as Yale and Harvard, and thus cannot attract quite so many of the brilliant underprivileged students they do, but it attracts excellent students nevertheless and gives them an education that allows them to succeed at all the things they try. Top schools produce doctors, CEOs, and top researchers. They also produce plenty of management consultants, lawyers, and Presidents. The dark side of talent and excellence is that highly skilled people may well go into fields such as law or management consulting that hurt people. Very well, but the fact is that these are highly competitive fields, and do not take anyone who wants. The fact that they are recruiting heavily at Princeton shows that they see Princeton's graduates as extremely well educated and thus ideal for their purposes. You talk about fields like teaching - well, schools like Harvard and Yale produce an outsize number of students who go into Teach for America (or many such other options) and become stellar teachers. You cannot judge a program by how many people go into teaching, but rather by how good they are once they choose that field. But if you did go by the numbers, elite schools do not fall short. So if a top school produces well educated students who excel, and if some of those excel at fields that help people while others excel at fields that may cause more harm than good, simply look at the net result.

If something is advertised as life insurance, it's life insurance. The exact rules might be too complex for a 30-second spot, but it's not going to turn out to be a warranty on a microwave. Deception is already illegal, and there is no trickery going on in any of your examples. Some advertisers do lie, and you're sure to be able to find some if you look hard enough. But disagreement about what's healthy and/or brief descriptions of complex products hardly count as deception.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

We also want our kids to be taught by the very best teachers and to have every opportunity for personal growth/learning. That literally can't be given to every kid - there will always be some teachers who are better than others, and some opportunities that are limited.

Maybe a nuclear exchange, sure. Educational reforms are unlikely to weaken us given our very diverse educational system - if one kind of school is driven to failure, we have other competitor schools.

Nah, if the customs agent checking their passport is confused she can Google it or look in her reference manual. Countries update their passport standards all the time and this is a pretty minor change. Changes to passports do not make travelers' lives particularly difficult. '.

But the combination of the two approaches - with Magneto inflaming human prejudice (perhaps he's right that it will be there no matter what he does) and yet being thwarted by more liberal mutant factions every time is not working out for mutants as a whole. Of course, some individual mutants may benefit from this conflict. One hates to take away from certain heroes' heroism, but some mutants have a respected place in the context of Professor X's struggle against Magneto but would not have as good a position if mutants lived in harmony with or control over humans. Is it possible at some level that they are fueling the conflict rather than allowing one side to win? And of course, the government may well be controlled (sometimes explicitly is, sometimes not) by other mutant factions who like having the resources of the government at their disposal but wouldn't do so well if other mutants were permitted equal power to compete with them.

That includes cataract surgery, root canals, ankle repair, mitral valve replacement, everything. Sure, you need to consult with a doctor on what works and what the consequences will be - but in terms of value (how much value you put on pain, mobility, risk, etc) only you are a judge. Now, we need insurance or the government to handle expensive catastrophes. I don't care how much you value not dying of lung cancer, you aren't going to save up enough for that unless you happen to be rich. So for that we need a government or corporation to pay, and the tradeoff is that we lose the ability to make good decisions about what's worth it. The government doesn't know you as well as you know you, so it must overpay (pay for surgeries that aren't really worth it to you if you consider the money it costs) or underpay (refuse to pay for surgeries that really are worth it to you) or both. It's a tradeoff. Now, for dental and vision care, the costs are lower in general (though apply to more people). So that puts less weight on the ""but most people can't afford this rare catastrophe"" since people typically can afford services, leaving more weight comparatively on the ""but only I know how much my teeth are worth to me"". If those services become unaffordable to the average person, it would start to make a lot of sense to have the government cover them, but since they are affordable it is more efficient to let you buy your own.'.

For nearly two centuries, the idea that an ""expert"" in economics or policy was someone who had studied the subject in school was laughable. Then came television. Suddenly, we no longer needed men of accomplishment to listen to. Instead, we needed men (and eventually women) who could talk sagely, look good on camera, and had an easily identifiable tag-line that could be printed under their face to explain why the network had chosen this specific person. Suddenly, credentials were vital. This wasn't the whole story, of course - another huge part was the post-WWII rise of credentialism.

"The argument: 'There is two clear differences between Uber/Lyft and other taxi deregulation experiences: the ability to price compare prior to entering a taxi and the ability to drive a taxi opportunistically. In the Wikipedia's listed examples, riders are unable to find fare information prior to entering a taxi. One can ask a driver, reject his offer, and wait for a new taxi... but that costs the rider a lot of time. In the Lyft/Uber model, one can discover a taxi's price far more easily. So this will drive down fares rather than increasing them. In the traditional model (with or without deregulation), if I drive a taxi that's what I'm doing with my time. I look around for fares and drive them around, and then when I'm done I can do what I want with my life. If I spend 2 hours ferrying passengers, that's 2 hours gone from my day. In the Lyft/Uber model, if I'm driving home from work I can pick up fares essentially along the way. I might well spend 45 minutes ferrying passengers while adding only 15 minutes to my travel time. This kind of opportunistic taxi is energy-efficient since much of the gasoline would have been spent anyway by the driver on her already-planned travel. So if Lyft/Uber become more widespread, it's true we're putting a bunch of taxi drivers out of business. But we're letting people get rides more cheaply, we're spending less of our fossil fuels, and we're letting people with long commutes get some extra compensation by taking on passengers. '.

"The argument: 'Theoretically you are right, but practically you have it reversed: psychology is much less likely to be valid cross-culturally than psychiatry is. Most psychology studies are done specifically on WEIRD subjects (Western, Educated, from Industrialized, Rich, Democratic countries). The findings frequently do not generalize to all cultures. When we study fairness, reasoning style, etc, there is little reason to believe that the results are the same in Haiti as they are in Harvard. Psychiatry, on the other hand, focuses primarily on things that are really broken - things that break in much the same ways regardless of culture. Schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, addiction, etc etc. Now of course to some extent rich countries have a culture that says ""yes, it's worth lots of money to treat depression"" where poor countries cannot afford such treatment. But the thing is, they would if they could. We see it - as they become richer, they adopt the same value on treatment. Sure, you describe the possibility that a particular schizophrenic person might be seen as a holy man - and this occasionally occurs - but usually not. And psychiatrists already learn to take cultural differences in presentation into account. They do not say ""I saw an angel"" is a clear delusion if the person being evaluated is part of a religion/culture that sees angels all the time. So psychiatry really isn't about enforcing the values of leadership onto other people (with the exceptions of preventing suicide and attacks on others - and sure I can see that's culturally based, but most of psychiatry isn't about those). It's really about people choosing treatment for conditions that exist in every culture, are recognized by every culture that learns of them (there aren't cultures that say ""I understand you call this schizophrenia, but I promise you it's something holy instead"", though there are specific rare individuals about whom they might say ""I understand that if you didn't know what I know you'd assume this was schizophrenia but I promise you it's something holy instead""), and are valued basically universally.

I've eaten meals under both systems and I think that it would just more simple to raise food prices and get rid of tips all together. I find it odd that one person who gives me service needs a tip, but other cases when I get service,I don't have to tip. Tipping isn't really done anymore to insure anything as, most of the time, the waiter will simply assume that they will get a tip. It is seen by most servers as simply a given. Your view now adds an extra layer. The patron now has to go through this odd guilt based social interaction. I guess the reasoning is that if they won't give a tip, they should provide some level of personal discomfort to make things better. I don't quite see the need for this step. I mean is this to make the server feel better for shaming their patron? Does anyone really benefit from this exchange. The patron still leaves with leaving no tip. The waiter can pay their bills with guilt trips so they are still where they started in the first place. And there is a lot of time wasted with awkward conversations.

For example, let's say a school district has five elementary schools, each with 2 classes of 25 kids. That's 250 kids. Let's say the charter school runs their own class, and takes on 25 kids. So now, you've got 25 kids in the charter school, and 225 kids spread across five schools. If all the charter kids are picked randomly, that means each public school went from having to teach 50 kids to 45 kids. That costs the school a lot of money in charter school costs, but they can't really save any money, because each school would have 45 kids, so they still need two classes. The only way the school district can make back that money is through a massive reorg and likely closing one of the schools, which is a complex and expensive process.

"The argument: 'Let's try to look at your query quantitatively, as a STEM major would. You've conceded the point that, on average, STEM majors tend to do better than non-STEM majors, no one is disputing that. But let's look at the bottom rung of STEM majors to see how they are doing. Thanks to Georgetown's [What It's Worth](https://cew.georgetown.edu/report/whats-it-worth-the-economic-value-of-college-majors/) study, we have median salary and unemployment data across a wide range of majors. As expected, lots of the top slots are taken by various STEM fields, like petroleum engineering and computer science. But what about the worst STEM majors? In Biology and Life Sciences, Botany has the worst median salary at 42,000 (with a 3% unemployment rate). The highest unemployment rate is at 8% for Zoology majors. In Physical Sciences, Nuclear Engineering has the lowest median salary at 52,000 (with a 2% unemployment rate). The highest unemployment rate is 9% for Physical Science majors. Remember, this survey was done in 2011, when the national unemployment rate was right around 9%, and the median salary was about 45,000 So, basically, even if you major in the least popular and least marketable STEM major on record, you can still expect to make a median salary and have average unemployment. That's pretty good odds. Never mind that if you have one of these ""bad"" STEM degrees, its relatively easy to train into one of the more lucrative ones.

"The argument: 'I can't comment on the situation in these European countries specifically, but I commented on a similar post a while ago in regards to the US, reposting here, since I think its relevant. Below is a bit of context, and a clarifying question. &gt; In the United States, as far as I know, The last time this was brought to the Supreme Court was in 1981 (link below). The Supreme Court decision was basically, ""since only men can fight, it makes sense to only register men"". (I'm not a law scholar, you can read the decision yourself if you are interested). Given that, in the last 30 years, the US military has changed significantly, and women are now fighting in just about every role of the Army, that decision seems ripe to be revisited. However, it won't be automatically changed unless someone does something about it. Someone would need to either challenge the law again, or lawmakers would need to change it. I don't see either happening unless there is a pressing need for the draft to actually be implemented. Laws don't automatically change when the social situation changes. In order for the laws to change you either need someone to challenge the law in the courts and have it overturned, or you need to have a lawmaker invest the political capital in drafting a new law. Both of these courses of actions would require a significant investment of time and material. In the US, since we don't have mandatory military service, the arguments are mostly academic. In countries with mandatory military service, the issue becomes much more interesting, since there is an actual cost to be born by the male citizens.

Being in a very math-intensive major with a lot of homework, the reduced stress of not having to do all of it on TOP of statistics and chemistry allowed me to focus on my actual core classes, rather than spending all of my time powering through low-level gen-ed classes that I already knew everything about.

"The argument: 'I can only speak for myself, so I can tell you the problem that I have with it. There are a few facets to it. Firstly, I think it makes people feel like they're helping, when they really aren't. You can talk all you like about the ""power of social media"", but that's basically just an example of what I'm talking about. You changing your profile picture does exactly nothing for anyone. I'm not saying you SHOULD be doing more, because like you said, there's really not much that you CAN do. But there was a time when you accepted that you'd LIKE to be able to help, but that you simply aren't in a position to be able to. Now we've gotten to a point where we think we DID help because we changed a profile picture or re-tweeted something. So I would flip it around and say that the people doing it are the ones with a moral superiority complex. Or at least an inflated ego. I can't help the people in France right now. I know that, and I accept it. I'd love to be able to, but nothing I can feasibly do is going to take away from what happened. So I'm not going to pretend like I made a difference by ""raising awareness"" about something that the entire world knows about. And they don't need my support. It's a given. Every person with a heart in any country on Earth is supportive of the victims of this and empathetic to their families. It doesn't make me special to say that ""I stand with France."" Big deal, so does everyone else. If this were something divisive, like if there were a big fight going on about whether France deserved it, and there were scores of people saying they were happy about what happened, then sure, it would make some sense to say ""Hey guys, we're with you."" But when 99.9% of the developed world is on the same side, then you're really not doing anything by saying you're supportive. It's not for France. It's to make you feel good about yourself for doing basically nothing. '. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

That said, a warmer climate means increased energy demand. Many electric plants do not have the capability to deal with a summer where people are using their HVAC 30% more. Rising sea level threatens coastal communities in ways that only BILLIONS of dollars of prevention can alleviate. Remember what happened to New Orleans during Katrina? A sea level that's a meter higher means that's going to happen more easily when a major storm impacts the area. Shifting precipitation patterns will cause huge problems for drier areas, such as the American southwest, where an extended drought could threaten millions of people.

If you don't like how Washington reacts to it, or how the media portrays it, that doesn't invalidate the science. 2) Weather and climate are entirely different concepts, and understanding that is step 1.

We're not trying to tell you the forecast for rain on Oct. 3, 2075, so that's really not a good comparison. I can tell you with some pretty solid confidence that it's going to be warmer in July than it was today. 3) Never mention Al Gore around us. To even lump him in is simply a distraction from the actual science. 4) There have been warmer periods, and with more CO2. The extent is not the concern right now, it's the rate at which it's happening. Previous warmings have taken tens to hundreds of thousands of years. This time it has taken less than a century. The planet simply cannot adapt that quickly. That's the problem. If it took 10,000 years, we'd be just fine. That's slow enough that species (including us) can adapt with the changing climate. 5) The thing you've said about the sun is just patently false. The solar variation accounts for a miniscule fraction of observed warming. 6) The ""hockey stick"" is not a prediction. It's observation (i.e. it's already happened), so no, that's not a problem with models. Yes, the modeled future continues that same path, but it's already happening. 7) The urban heat island effect only affects a handful of stations around the planet, and that's accounted for in the climate summary.

Even if we were to agree that the military needs to remain as strong and influential as it is, why does that immediately imply that their budget must remain the same. Nearly every government agency deals with budget cuts, and they find a way to continue operating at the same level of professionalism and skill. Why must the military be given a $650 billion blank check every year, without anyone questioning whether the money could be spent more efficiently? And if you know how the federal budget ""works"", then you'll see why this is a problem. As long as money is given to them, it will be spent, because to NOT spend it means that it will probably get taken away next year. Budget surplus is a bad word in the land of federal agencies. This isn't unique to the military, but if you want an agency to spend less, the only way to accomplish that is to take it away, and FORCE them to make the changes necessary to do the same job with less money. The US military **literally, not figuratively** spent over $3 million in the time it took me to write this post. Do you think they needed to?'.

My point is that if anyone and everyone can use whichever bathroom they like, then why are we still bothering to label them in the first place. So I believe it's hypocritical to simultaneously say that you support having two separate restrooms, but also that you want someone to be able to use whichever one they like. It renders having two of them completely pointless. But what you don't get to do is say ""I only want THESE people to be able to do that. Everyone else has to keep doing it the other way."" You don't get to extend rights and privileges to some people but not others. That's the definition of discrimination.

And I think we all understand that letting yourself die (which let's be honest, he wasn't going to do) over a university president's job is incredibly stupid. So, I'm not too concerned about the precedent. He resigned because of a much larger backlash, not because of this one idiot. Public opinion (or at least the loud part of it) was against him regardless of this hunger strike. Hell, I didn't even know about it until you posted this. That's why he resigned.

The decisions that have to be made on a daily basis require extensive amounts of background knowledge and research, and quite frankly, they shouldn't be left to the gut reactions of the voting majority. If you put the question of ""Should we launch a rocket to the moon tomorrow?"" to a public vote, it would probably pass with flying colors. Because no one voting bothered to look at the budget, or even if a rocket trip to the moon was physically possible this week. They just heard ""Shit yeah, rocketship to the moon!!"" and pulled the yes handle. It isn't that we necessarily hold these people in higher regard (I certainly don't). It's that someone has to be delegated as the person whose job it is to know this crap, to be in tune with all of the facts that should go into multi-billion dollar decisions and matters of policy.

This community, in particular, shares the common bond of living in a society where we're always a slim minority. In any city in America, we're at best 15% of the population. We go through each day bombarded by religion, and a place like /r/atheism is nothing more than a place to get together where we can say what *we* want to say. Yes, a lot of times that's venting about religion, because what brought us all there in the first place is our mutual experience of dealing with religion. To just talk about not believing in God? That's not a common thing you can talk about. What would you say? ""Does everyone still not believe? Nope? Me neither. Awesome. See you tomorrow.""

The reason it's ""okay"" to make fun of Mormons is because, honestly, Mormons are incredibly good sports about it. By and large, they were pretty positive about the musical, and even took the opportunity to put ads for the church inside the Playbill when I went to see it, and they were waiting outside to hand out actual Books of Mormon.

Either to protect yourself, or to protect someone's feelings from being unnecessarily hurt, or some other reason. It's just something that you reason out on your own. So rather than trying to logically explain to a kid when it is and isn't okay to disregard the ""rules"" about honesty, I think it's best to just encourage them to be honest, and let them figure out for themselves that sometimes, it's smarter to lie. Personally, I told my wife I look forward to the first time my kid consciously lies. I think it's a pretty big milestone mentally.

Consider abortion - you can be pro-choice based on body autonomy, economic freedom, or because you don't think an embryo counts. You can be pro-life because your religion says so, because you think life begins at conception and abortion is murder, or because you believe that people should have to deal with the consequences of their actions. Now, some might say if you are pro life, you must be anti-death penalty. But maybe your religion says nothing about capital punishment, or you care about personal responsibility and consequences, which are perfectly consistent with supporting the death penalty.

"The argument: 'While I think the IRA's tactics were reprehensible, the Irish have been wanting independence since the Norman invasion. Around 1600, Britain began the policy of ""plantation"" where Irish Catholics were displaced and their land given to English and Scottish settlers. Laws were passed to keep the Catholic majority from voting or holding office. The, in the Irish War of Independence after WWI, the Catholics won independence in all but the 6 counties of Northern Ireland, but the Irish considered it still part of their Ancestral home. In the following decades, the Protestants in Northern Ireland were not exactly compassionate toward the Catholics (who, in fairness, wanted them out), which didn't help matters. The republicans wouldn't consider it ""territorial expansion"", but ""getting back what was stolen by the British"". They view the entire island as Ireland, with their Celtic tradition, language, and culture. Of course, many of the Protestant families have lived there for centuries, so it's easy to see both sides, but the idea of a united Ireland has a lot of appeal for Irishmen.'.

There were 562k deaths in the 50 years before that. The modern era has seen unprecedented peace among the world powers. A large part of that has to do with the modern weapon systems. I'm no fan of the Iraq and Afghan wars, but between the two of them, the US suffered under 7,000 casualties. Obviously, there are serious questions about how the wars (and more importantly, the aftermath of the wars) were handled, but there can be no doubt that other countries with a grudge against the US can't help but look at how much the US could do with so few casualties and do the math. Fewer countries willing to attack the US or its Allies (or Russia or China for similar reasons) means fewer wars, and those that there are tend to be small skirmishes. While it's possible that there are diplomatic means that could have achieved the same results, it's hard to argue that, given the current geopolitical reality, you haven't saved lives.'.

Now, personally, he might be an assholes who beats his wife and steals from the blind beggar, and if he were my neighbor I'd want nothing to do with him. But I respect his job, and the fact that he'd do something for the good of the public that I wouldn't do means something. Now think about soldiers. They have signed up to let the government, even one they don't approve of (which is particularly the case for most of the soldiers in the US) decide how to use them, even if that means putting them at great risk of death. You may disagree with some of the recent US/UK foreign policy decisions - many in the military do too. But it wouldn't work to have a military where the soldiers get to vote whether they feel like getting deployed. Do you dispute the need for a military? If we unilaterally disarmed and demobilized every soldier, do you think that China wouldn't instantly take Taiwan, North Korea wouldn't head south and Iran wouldn't do whatever they wanted? Regardless of whether you agree with recent military actions, if you agree you need an army, then you need soldiers willing to die. Are they idiots? Well, are firemen?

Whether it's toiling in the fields with a child strapped to their back, or doing laundry, cooking and cleaning while the men labor, the idea of the ""full time mom"" is a recent, and short lived model. As long as the child's needs are being met, having two parents who can act as role models, bring in new ideas and care for the children is a benefit. I don't really know what being ""more concerned with results than communications"" is supposed to mean. Even if you've been watching a lot of '50's TV with ditzy housewives who need to wait for their husband to explain the world to them, they are still concerned with the ""results"" of keeping their families fed, cleaned and educated.

And of course Orwell feared that, seeing the measures the UK had taken during WWII, they could be heading down the same path. But while the details have changed, human nature hasn't. Plays like Henry V and Richard III were written about a very different time, yet are still relevant, because when you expose leaders to power the same things happen. The NSA is a far, far cry from the thought police, but it's helpful to have 1984 as a reminder of where unchecked government surveillance can lead. We don't go as far as ""War is Peace"" and ""Freedom is Slavery"" today, but Orwell brilliantly predicted how language can be twisted and shaped - rebranding an ""inheritance tax"" as a ""death tax"" suddenly makes it evil, the demonizing of the word ""socialism"", ""pro-choice"" vs. ""pro-life"". All politicians these days are about ""staying on message"", so the message becomes the reality. Also, I don't know how old you are, so I don't know how much of the aftermath on 9/11 (particularly in the US) you were aware of at the time. But people were scared, and were perfectly prepared to turn over a lot of freedom for a little security. Bush moved in that direction (which lead us down the path to the current NSA abuses) but didn't go too far. If there had been another attack, and a president who believed in security at any cost, the US would have been much closer to 1984 than it currently is.

Now, let's say there was a 6-10 year term limit.

These people will be no more in touch with current events than the current Supremes are, and possibly less. Besides, judges have brilliant young clerks working for them - if they need insight into ""what's this thing called reddit"", there are plenty of ways for them to find out.

""A family of four on their way to a movie to celebrate the child's birthday was killed by a drunk driver"" has a far more visceral impact on most people, even though it's a much smaller number. Also, particularly when it comes to children, age DOES make a difference. Children aren't *supposed* to die. Most societies are set up to protect and nurture children - so that even those without children share in the cost of educating them, because they are of course the future. There's also the question of ""innocence"". While to you they were just bystanders, a terrorist could see all American adults as supporting the system they oppose.

"The argument: '1. It doesn't make sense to hold her responsible for Bill's actions, which she wasn't consulted on, and had no authority over. 2. While I agree that the War on Iraq was a mistake, and thought so at the time, her decision was based on the information that was provided to her at the time. There was good reason to believe (from what the Senate was told, even though it was lies) that there were WMDs that Sadaam was willing to use. There was also the (naive) neocon story line that Sadaam would be overthrown easily (true) and that a stable government would be set up to replace it quickly and easily (wrong, wrong, wrong). And all of this would be accomplished primarily through airpower. Very few people expected the quagmire, civil war, IEDs, and endless war. 58% of Senate Democrats voted for the bill. Again, I don't think it was the right call, but she was hardly alone in making that call (and it's not like her vote mattered, since the margin was 27 votes in the Senate). 3. Again, this was hardly a ""Hillary-only"" decision. It was supported by the US allies, and had the support of the UN Security Council - hardly a pro-US group. Gadaffi was slaughtering protesters, and was not a ""good guy"" on anyone's list. The bigger problem here wasn't the bombing, but the crappy management of the aftermath. 4. I'm not going to argue with a citation from the ""Electronic Intifada"". The Israel/Palestine situation is extremely complex with plenty of blame on both sides, and it a CMV in itself. 5. I'm not sure how you draw the conclusion that ""the banks ask her to promote her war hawk history"".

It's an awesome responsibility, but an amazing opportunity, to navigate through the lify-ness of life and try to end up with decent children. You also get to redo a bunch of firsts. I'm sure that even if you like fireworks (or rainbows, or any other thing of stunning beauty), you're pretty calm about it. But when your kid sees it for the first time, you get to re-appreciate that wonder. The same goes for introducing them to your favorite movie, book, tv show, dessert or whatever. My son is now in college. He's become such an amazing young man - I think a lot of it is just him being who he is, but we at least didn't screw him up too badly.

They are taught that all phenomena are explainable through god. If you grew up without an understanding of the scientific method, creationism seems far more plausible than evolution. If you are taught that coincidences are proof of gods involvement, again, you see much proof for your view.

"The argument: 'When you are talking about staging plays or casting movies, I don't have any problem with a (well executed) female Hamlet, an Asian Othello or a wheelchair-bound Henry V. You're taking a well known, and extensively analyzed text and using it to look at things from a different perspective, which can be brilliant. But there are still fresh productions being made with the ""standard"" interpretation - so you aren't losing anything, just getting something new to consider. Comics can be different. My dad was a kid in WWII, and he read the adventures of Steve Rogers as Captain America. As a kid I read about Peter Parker, and together we saw the only real James Bond, Sean Connery. The creators have a tough task. On the one hand they need to preserve the spirit of the original character, and letting the long-time fan-boys and girls revel in the off-hand comments that are only understood by those immersed in the character's history. On the other, if you read a comic from the 40's or 50's, it's incredibly dated and unsophisticated. You need to keep it interesting and relevant to capture new readers- which means Jimmy Olson, newsboy, doesn't really have a place in 2014. Honestly, I think the people complaining loudest are those like me - who used to be loyal readers, but based on time, money and life priorities have drifted away. I like the fact that, 20 years after dropping comics, I can still get most of the references in the recent batch of movies. But if you mess around with the characters and their histories, I lose that connection, which saddens me. Especially since once they've killed Steve Rogers, or made Thor female, there aren't new stories being made with the characters I'd loved. I wouldn't say I'm ""offended"", and I even understand why they do it, but it still feels like they are bulldozing the park you played at when you were a kid. What they replace it with might be better, but it won't be yours.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

You need to go into the demographics of your town, the diversity of the industry, the skills needed by the workforce, the jobs that might have been outsourced, the education levels, then the whole global economic situation.

Foreign policy is a dance between what we say we do, and what we're actually doing. There's all sorts of public posturing that is covering all sorts of behind the scenes sleight of hand. That's part of the reason why the Snowden/Assange stuff is so damaging, because it pulled away the curtain to reveal what was really going on. Not saying that's all bad, but it changes the game. &gt;Why wouldn't you get IBM to run Healthcare.gov from the start? Because there is a convoluted bidding process to try to keep the system from being corrupted. You can't just say ""IBM will do a good job, we'll just pick them"". If IBM came in more expensive than the others who claimed to be able to do the job, then some Republicans would be saying,""Look IBM gave money to Democrats (since they give money to everyone), and that's why they are wasting your money needlessly"".

"The argument: 'My father taught at a state university (but not the ""flagship"" school). I went to an elite university. Since I majored in the subject that he taught, he'd occasionally give me his tests to make sure he was getting his money's worth. There's no question that my classes were more rigorous. That said, the city where he taught had a lot of immigrants. He had some brilliant students who were not only putting themselves through school, but also supporting their families. I know of one at least who went on to get a doctorate at MIT. To imply that students at the ""better"" school are universally ""better"" is unfounded. As other have said, there are ways to raise your GPA by taking less challenging classes at the ""better"" school. Also, there tends to be more grade inflation at the top schools, which can also make the comparison unfair. Yes, employers should look at the reputation of the school, but it's only a minor indicator, not nearly as strong as a distinctions as you imply.'.

I posted a couple of CMVs that seemed pretty cool at first. But what I didn't consider first was *how could my view be changed*? It seems kind of obvious, but I think it gets to the heart of the matter. This post is a great example. Since you use words like ""majority"", I can't point to a single post to show where someones view was changed. I suppose we could do a statistical analysis of all of the posts, and figure out what percentage had deltas awarded, but that could just be a measure of how good the responses were, not the OP's intentions.

Your friend's beliefs are based on similar inputs, including religion. She weighs that pretty strongly. And her church makes it clear that gay marriage is wrong. They probably don't have a similar stand on health care or taxation - but maybe on abortion or the death penalty.

Unless you are the handful of articulate athletes with a future as a broadcaster, your goal is to get through the presser without saying something that is either going to get you suspended, inspire the other team, or end up going viral when taken out of context (or in context). It's probably the most miserable part of the job for most of these guys- and these are people who get bashed for 60 minutes each week. Now, if you're particularly shy or awkward, it's got to be extra painful. It sucks for the player. It sucks for the interviewers. It sucks for the audience. Yeah, I could see the desire to skip it in that case. Not sure what your job is, but say you're a well-paid software engineer. you don't have it that bad, but if your manager decides that you are all going into the local 2nd grade to teach coding for Day of Code and you hate children, chances are you're not going to be thrilled.'.

The same thing can certainly hold true between adults. If someone is proud that they ran 10k, even though I'm a marathon runner, I can still say ""good for you"" and mean it sincerely.

"The argument: 'There are two key problems with addressing whether it ""will help [you] become a better person"". First, none of us know what kind of person you are, other than being a 23 year old virgin. Clearly, not so good with women. But without knowing if you're incredibly introverted, come across abrasively, are ugly as sin, lack all empathy, spent the last 22.5 years in a monastery or are just unlucky, it's hard to say whether lack of assertiveness has anything to do with it. Second, we don't know what you mean by a ""better person"". From the description, it seems like you mean ""a person more likely to get laid"", but that's a pretty limiting definition of being a better person. Third, I don't see how the ""Red Pill philosophy"" really enters in to it. You don't need philosophy, you just need to get better at reading women. SOME women want the man to be more aggressive. Some are turned off by it. Some might be waiting for a sign that you are interested. Some might think that comes across as needy. Rather than adopting a philosophy, I'd say you need to do two things: 1. Take a good look at yourself. If you have female friends willing to be honest with you - guy friends too. Is there stuff that you are doing that's getting in the way of your goals? 2. Screw the Red Pill, the Green Tablet and the Puce Capsule. Observe people and see what they seem to want.

The Minnesota abomination, on the other hand has note of the benefit. Clearly, a gray duck is still a duck. A child would be correct to say, ""duck, duck, duck"". No, all it does it teach that we should be aware of color distinctions, and that somehow, despite being a duck in every way, ""gray ducks"" should be singled out for special treatment.

"The argument: 'There is certainly some truth in your argument. The rise of the American middle class in the 50s and 60s was largely based on manufacturing jobs where the unions had negotiated good wages. Globalization has moved most manufacturing offshore. But that's not the whole story. The top federal income tax rate in 1944 was 94% at an 2011 equivalent of $2.5mm. In 1981, it was 70% at the equivalent of $532,000. It's now 39.6% at $388k equivalent. That's a pretty massive difference. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#History_of_top_rates) On the other end of the spectrum, from 1956-1982, the Federal Minimum wage ranged from $5.42 to $7.21 in 1996 dollars, averaging somewhere in the $6.00 range. Since then, it hasn't broken $5.30 and hit a low of $4.04, averaging probably around $4.75 (again, all in 1996 dollars). http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0774473.html That link you gave doesn't really support your argument when you get beyond the headline: &gt; When factoring in state and local taxes, the top 10% pay just under half the tab. And when calculating tax burden as a percent of income, the tax code is even less progressive. The top 10% paid an average of 30% of their income in local, state, and federal taxes in 2011, said McIntyre. That's not much different than the 25% percent paid by the middle class. &gt;""The system is a little progressive, but not much,"" McIntyre said. &gt;Still, the wealthy are paying more taxes on a federal level simply because they are making so much more money. The top 10% of taxpayers take home 45% of the nation's income, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. Moreover, they seem to be getting richer all the time.

To say a city or a web community with millions of people has a single outlook on anything isn't realistic. And in a society which supports free speech, some of that speech is going to be ugly. I think it's a minority of redditors who feel that way, but honestly, even if it were the majority, if free speech were valued to the extent that an anti-racism sub could survive, the service it provided to that community would make it worthwhile.

"The argument: 'There is already a hierarchy of morality when it comes to abortion. * Some say it's never ok. * Some say it's only ok to save the life of the mother * Others allow for it in the case of rape or incest * Some think it's ok if there is a birth defect. * Some think it's ok if the child can't be cared for sufficiently All of these are trade offs between the mothers needs and wants vs the fetus. It's no where near as black and white as you imply. The least restrictive reason is the abortion of convenience, of which gender-based is a subset. (I'm excluding cases where there are genetic reasons for not wanting a baby of a gender that's susceptible to some disease) Now, a parent who is making that choice is obviously saying at one sex is better or more desirable than another. I'm not sure how that can be anything other than sexism. What would you think if a woman had slept with two guys, one Asian and one white, and did a test on the fetus. If the baby was Asian, she'd abort it, if it was white she'd keep it. (And let's say that she was half each). Wouldn't you consider that racist? Why would his be different?'.

They have had good seasons, but there have also had some dreadful teams over the years. Yet many fans stayed with them throughout it all. While they sucked, there was a bond formed among the faithful - that they were the few, the noble sufferers, the Charlie Browns who could somehow after every crappy season say, ""Wait'il Next Year""! The is something admirable about being able to keep that faith, about knowing your heart is going to be broken time after time, but still you believe. I grew up as a Red Sox fan, and while they didn't suck like the Pirates, you KNEW they would blow it somehow. Time after time, they'd figure out a new way to make us believe and then trample on our hearts.

"The argument: 'First, of course there are already laws in place for accessories and accomplices to be charged. So, if these family members were in any way involved, they can indeed be prosecuted. But what you are proposing would require two sets of facts to be established: 1. The terrorist exhibited observable behaviors that established that they were a threat 2. The family member observed these behaviors and a reasonable person would have interpreted them as a threat. For number one, exactly what behaviors would establish that? Checking out a web site? Being gone during the day? Hanging out with other young angry people? Buying a gun? All of these things are very common activities. Yes, a family member might have wondered what was going on and being concerned, but if every parent who was concerned about a brooding teen called Homeland Security, we'd need a whole lot more agents. As for the second, how are you going to know what a family member observed? Given the constitutional protections against self-incrimination, you'd need to have a third party who observed the family member observing the behavior or checking the web history. How likely is that? Finally, do you really think it's realistic to expect the family to turn them in if they weren't blatantly talking about the crime they were planning to commit (and again, even then, who is going to testify that the terrorist said that)? Parents are notorious for thinking the best of their kids. They are going to be the last ones to believe that their kids are planning to blow someone up. Or they'll talk to them and be assured by their child that, no, of course they would never do that. Besides that, I can't imagine calling to police to send my kid to jail in general, much less for something that he hasn't done yet. It just doesn't have a way to work realistically.'.

"The argument: 'Yep, kids/teens that age don't have the same experiences that you do. And, generally, have less experience, simply due to the difference in the amount of time that they have been alive. But, teens don't have a monopoly on ill-informed. A quick review of talk radio in the United States (and presumably elsewhere) quickly demonstrates that there's no shortage of ignorance among adults either. But there's a difference- most teens, at least the ones worth bothering with, are still learning. Yes, they feel passionate in their beliefs- but they are also more likely to be open to changing their views in the light of evidence. Moreover, most thoughtful adults have been beaten in to accepting a world of greys, where some things can't be changed, and need to be accepted. But often teens believe in justice, and right and wrong, and getting off their ass and DOING something. This is incredibly valuable, both for themselves, society, and for adults, who often can be jolted out of our sedentary lives by their passion. I'm not sure which of their concerns you find ""mind-numbingly irrelevant and unimportant"". My 17 year old son and his friends worked to pass gay marriage here in Minnesota, care about politics and human rights, and create great music. Sure, some of the ""daily life of a high school student"" is trivial, but so is ""the daily life of an office worker"" to those who aren't living it. I don't think my frustrations with my boss are any more unimportant than his frustrations with his teacher. But I think the biggest problem is that you condescend to anyone. I'm a pretty smart guy with a good job and a degree from a great college. But the guy who picks up the trash in my office knows things that I don't, and has insights that I wouldn't have. If we try to learn from everyone, and accept what they have to teach, we'll be better off, regardless of how old we are.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

So, yeah, all things being equal, a parent will know more about parenting than a random stranger who has no experience with kids. But that's not what you wrote. For instance, any of the following may have equally valid or superior insights into parenting: * teachers * nannies * people who raised their younger siblings * people who majored in child study * psychologists * physicians * grandparents I hope you get the point. There are many inept parents. Let's look at Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, who didn't see anything wrong with repeatedly hitting a four year old with a stick until the boys buttocks and scrotum bled. I think it's fair to say that 90% of non-parents have more valid opinions on discipline than he does. There are still things I'm learning, and I have a 19 and a 15 year old.

Terminally ill people already participate in controlled clinical trials even though they know it's unlikely to help them personally. Next, how do you assess the ""price"" to pay for each experiment? What's a month of starvation worth? Near drowning? Removing pieces of a brain to see the effect? Finally, who would conduct these tests? They would be indistinguishable from torture- if your subject in the hunger test begs for food, who gets to walk by his cell? Would a neurosurgeon be willing to remove healthy tissue for the sake of experimentation, a clear violation of the edict, ""do no harm?""

"The argument: 'First of all, let's consider: &gt;all the bullshit the DNC pulled to sabotage Sanders Yes, the system is designed to make it difficult for a complete outsider to be nominated. Bear in mind, Trump could have just as easily declared himself a Democrat, and perhaps have won the nomination despite sharing very few of their values (as he did in many ways with the Republican nomination). The primaries are designed for people who have a preference for a party to select the person who best represents that party. There are many people who have spent untold hours building up the party over the years - doorknocking, fundraising, supporting candidates up and down the ticket, writing the party platform, creating voter databases and much more. That's what the primaries are about - who gets to use all of those resources that others have created. Yes, the system is screwed up in that a candidate cannot realistically win without the endorsement of one of the two parties, but that isn't the party's fault. I think it should be changed, but that doesn't change the fact that the primaries are not the semi-finals of a fair tournament - they are a mechanism for the party members to select their representative. Bernie had not declared that he was a Democrat until recently. He never helped the party, campaigned for down-ticket or other candidates, or acted like a Democrat. Yeah, he voted with them most of the time because they generally were closer to his views than the Republicans on virtual every issue (except gun control). Can you really blame the people who really believe in the goals of the party for not embracing Bernie? But regardless, what did they actually ""pull""? There was the inexcusably stupid email from the DNC employee - but no evidence that anyone did anything wrong. There are a lot of cases where the rules that were in place before Bernie even announced (such as closed primaries) favored Hillary. They did favor her - but that's not pulling something on Bernie, it's just how the rules were set up. There are cases where the local leaders - the ones who were elected in off years when Bernie's supporters didn't consider themselves Democrats - legally used the rules to their advantage (",[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.],6.0,True,Hobbies and Interests,"Self-direction: thought,Self-direction: action,Power: dominance,Security: personal,Universalism: nature"

Being an effective US Senator or Representative is incredibly difficult. It takes years to understand the nuances of the issues, and to learn how to build coalitions and consensuses to pass legislation. A large part of the reason Obama has been so ineffectual is that he brought in nothing but outsiders who have no idea how to get anything accomplished in Washington. If you ""threw everybody out"", we'd have a bunch of ignorant newbies running the most complex economy with the most powerful military on earth. One of two things would happen. Either the unelected staffers would take over and run everything behind the befuddled Congresspeople's backs, or they'd try to run it themselves, to disastrous effect. Just to give an example, when hearing of unrest in Chad, Sudan and Nigeria (and there's always unrest there, a lot of Americans would say, ""Who the hell cares?"" Except that those three countries account for 95% of the world's exports of Gum Arabic. Again, ""so what""? Well, it's a key ingredient in soft drink syrups, chocolate candies, gumdrops and marshmallows. Yes, if unrest in those countries cut off the supply of gum arabic, it would essentially end production of Coke and M&amp;Ms worldwide.

Instead, all of it is based on empirical anomalies. Once those observations are made, THEN the physicists start pondering, ""WHAT could explain this. [Here's what Einstein wrote](http://www.pitt.edu/jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters_2015_Jan_1/origins_pathway/index.html) about discovering Special Relativity: &gt;If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity c (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam of light as an electromagnetic field at rest though spatially oscillating. &gt;There seems to be no such thing, however, neither on the basis of experience nor according to Maxwell's equations. &gt;From the very beginning it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of such an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest. For how should the first observer know or be able to determine, that he is in a state of fast uniform motion? &gt;One sees in this paradox the germ of the special relativity theory is already contained."" Now, while his theory fit the limited data available at the time, the impressive thing is how many things it explained as we found new and different ways to make observations. But of course, what we end up is ""the best thing to explain the data that we've collected so far"". Newton's theories fit all of the data quite well until we gained the insight and equipment to consider relativistic speeds. At that point, Einsteinian physics became a better model. So, in a sense you're right that non-empirically-based theoretical physics has no merit - but there is no such thing. It's all empiricism that starts the theory going. And without the theory, we'd never be able to design further experiments which will tell us whether the theory works.'.

So they made a proclamation that concentration camp tattoos were an exception. It was something that was done to them, not done by them. The same applies in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and other Eastern religions that support vegetarianism. You aren't supposed to eat meat, but if someone prepares a dish that has a little bit of animal in it, and you eat it unknowingly, it's ok. The same logic applies to Christianity and most other religions. The spirit of the law is more important than the literal interpretation. In the same way, Muslims say you are only a sinner if you sin intentionally and knowingly. So if you unknowingly eat pork, it's fine. Also, if you are on a desert island and the only food available was pork, you are also allowed to eat it. &gt; If you make them commit a sin by touching them with pork after they have committed their attack, they will not enter heaven. So that's not true. If they do something that is morally right and incidentally get pork on themselves during the process, it's ok. Of course, in this example, they consider murdering innocent people to be morally just, which is absurd, but it's still consistent with their logic. This pork thing might still work though. Most Muslims who are murdering others don't know much about the laws of the religion or have a very strange interpretation of it. If they are willing to bastardize the ""don't kill innocent people"" part of it, maybe they'll take the pork thing literally too.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'Say you get your water by waiting for it to rain. The rainwater fills up a big tank and you use that water. If you wait for the water to fill up one gallon and drink it right away, you have enough water to drink 8 glasses a day. But now the tank is empty and you have to wait until it fills up again. That's great if you just want to drink water. But what happens when you need 15 gallons to run your washing machine? What happens when you want to flush a toilet, take a shower, run a dishwasher, etc.? You need to save up your water to get to those nicer things. Water is a renewable resource. There is an unlimited amount of it (unless you live in a dry area). But there is a limit on it. The limit is based on the rate at which you can obtain it. If you are at an all you can eat buffet, but you are only allowed 1 plate per hour, and the restaurant is only open for 8 hours. It's technically all you can eat, and the buffet is a renewable resource. But if you really think about it, the limit is 8 plates. Right now you can meet all your bills with the amount of money you get. There is an exact balance between money coming in and money going out. But you won't be able to afford the big purchases that are coming up in life. Just because something is a renewable resource doesn't mean you have unlimited access to it. http://www.phila.gov/water/educationoutreach/Documents/Homewateruse_IG5.pdf'.

Furthermore, even if Greece doesn't owe the refugees anything, it does owe Germany something. Germany, for better or worse, has decided to help the refugees. Greece can't pay back Germany the money they took, but they can at least help Germany by taking in refugees. 18 year olds in Greece shouldn't be expected to want to take the refugees in, but they should be expected to do it anyways.

He didn't ask the mortician to beat or kill anyone, but he did ask him to organize a beautiful funeral.

"The argument: 'I think you have a misguided view of what evolution or even natural selection encompass. The version you are describing is a very simplified ELI5 version that doesn't capture the nuance that allows the more complex evolutionary characteristics to happen. You seem to view evolution as the process by which a random mutation causes one organism to become slightly more adapted to an environment. Then that organism has more successful offspring and all the other organisms die off. That is the basic gist of it, but it doesn't capture the many ways that organisms share genetic information. For example, take the bacteria Staphylococcus Aureus. It causes all kinds of health problems. Doctors started using penicillin to kill the bacteria, but pretty soon afterwards, the bacteria became resistant, meaning that penicillin didn't kill them anymore. The reason why this could happen so fast is because the bacteria shared the resistant gene with other bacteria. Every bacteria didn't have to mutate on its own. After the first human invented fire, he didn't let all the other humans die. He taught them how to use fire too. Furthermore, the bacteria don't even have to share the genes with each other on their own. Viruses can transfer drug resistance genes to many different bacteria. Plus, things like induced mutation can cause the same mutation in multiple beings. If the sun comes out and 20 people put on sunglasses, it's not random. But it's not guided by any higher intelligence. The same factors that cause a change in one organism can cause a change in another. Evolution doesn't rely on just mutation and death to spread certain genes and traits. It would take absolutely forever to evolve complex characteristics if it did.

Its an all-inclusive song. Woodie Guthrie explicitly wrote that song to exemplify his communist/socialist views. It's been covered by many liberal singers and performed at many liberal events. It's pretty well known as the quintessential patriotic liberal song. The only reason it wasn't more lefty was because Guthrie was afraid of Joseph McCarthy (as pretty much everyone should have been while he was in power.) &gt; He was irritated by Irving Berlin's ""God Bless America,"" sung by Kate Smith, which seemed to be endlessly playing on the radio in the late 1930s. So irritated, in fact, that he wrote this song as a retort, at first sarcastically calling it ""God Blessed America for Me"" before renaming it ""This Land Is Your Land."" Guthrie's original words to the song included this verse: &gt; There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me. The sign was painted, said 'Private Property.' But on the backside, it didn't say nothing. This land was made for you and me. &gt; This verse was recorded by Moses Asch in 1944, but not released. In fact, Guthrie's recorded version was more or less lost until Smithsonian archivist Jeff Place heard the acetate master during a 1997 transfer of the recording to a digital format. Still, it was sung at rallies, around campfires and in progressive schools. It was these populist lyrics that had appealed to the political Left in America.

They don't have a personality problem in any other aspect of their life. But they still participate in body shaming. That suggests body shaming is a societal issue and not just a personal one. Note, this is changing. Fewer and fewer people are participating in body shaming. That means it's shifting from a societal problem to a personal one. But it's not quite there yet. Attitudes towards homosexuality are a good example of this process. In the 1980's, most people were homophobic. In the 1990's, things started to change. People were still homophobic, but the attitudes started to shift. ""I'm not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with it."" Then in the 2000's it shifted further.

The only reason why we think there is a 90s sound now is because it's been 25 years since the 90s started (and 15 since they ended.) It's only been 5 years since 2010. If you wait another 10 years, people will definitely be able to pick up on a distinctive 00's sound. As another example, just think about how long it takes a car to go from new to used to vintage to antique. It's really easy to pick up on the difference between a 70s car, an 80s car, and a 90s car, but it's tough to do the same for a 2000s car. But it's becoming more and more obvious with time. The big reason why is the change is gradual. It happens so slowly that it's hard to pick out a distinctive shift. People with glaucoma slowly lose their peripheral vision until they go blind, yet many of them don't even notice it. They lose a tiny bit of vision everyday without realizing.

But there are a bunch of other things that make terrorist attacks more tragic than other situations. 1. Terrorist attacks are unexpected. You know that there is a chance of getting killed when you go for a drive in your car. You know that x many people are going to have a heart attack somewhere in a given day. But terrorist attacks come out of nowhere. People are just walking down the street in a city like they do everyday, but they were then unexpectedly killed. It reminds people that things they considered perfectly safe aren't as safe as they imagined. As terrorist attacks become more frequent, people are getting used to them though. 2. There are 1000 homicides in a given day, but they all occur in different locations to different people. Terrorist attacks are concentrated killings. The most people killed in a given day might be 7 people if an SUV crashes. Once you get over 10 killings in a single location, it's probably the deadliest event of the day, if not month. 3. Many people (bigots in particular) lament terrorist attacks as a sign of the decline of Western civilization. Every time there is a terrorist attack, they think it's a sign of all the evils of people who are different from themselves. As such, it's not just the mass death that is tragic, but what it represents for their worldview. 4. The killings were intentional. It wasn't an unstoppable and surprising hurricane or earthquake. It wasn't an unpreventable disease. It was a human being purposefully choosing to kill other human beings. It's horrible because it was completely preventable with love and understanding.

That problem is that all the attacks on Clinton regarding the emails are based on circumstantial evidence. &gt; Circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact—like a fingerprint at the scene of a crime. By contrast, direct evidence supports the truth of an assertion directly—i.e., without need for any additional evidence or inference.

That's the reason why she isn't being prosecuted. **She did something negligent, but she didn't do anything illegal.** [That's what two 20 FBI agents, investigators, and analysts](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-james-comey-hillary-clinton-email-probe/story?id=41044927) who examined Clinton's case unanimously agreed upon. That's the basic standard of evidence in criminal law. What she did was negligent, meaning that someone could have hacked her emails. But no one actually did. The risk was there, but she took down the server, deleted the emails, and destroyed her phones before they were hacked.

For example, you can listen to music on a stereo. If you have a stereo on, you can still hear sounds like sirens and shouts. If you have headphones, it drowns those sounds out. In the same way, you can't tint your windows, but you can wear sunglasses. Other drivers can't talk to you so they look at your body language when you are driving. They look at how your wheels spin to see if you are speeding up or slowing down (which is why spinner rims are illegal). If they are behind you, they look at your breaklights to see if you are tapping on your brakes. They look for your turn signals to see if you are going to change lanes. And then look at the direction your head is facing to see what you are planning to do next. Drivers can't see or rely on your eyes, but they can see where your face is pointing. It's the same principle in basketball. Driving consists of a bunch of complete strangers who can't talk to each other interacting in a life or death situation. Everything is based on body language.

"The argument: '&gt; Nationalizing these reserves would allow the US to generate vase sums of money to pay down our debt and fund state and federal programs. 1. The US already generates a ton of revenue from the leases and taxes on American oil production, but shares significantly less risk. Right now American oil companies are hurting because of the collapse in the international oil price (oil was worth twice as much two years ago as now), but the rest of the American economy is doing relatively well. &gt; In addition to generating revenue we could reduce oil and gas prices for our citizens. The problem here is that if there is extra oil, the most economically efficient thing to do is to sell it to another country. The least efficient thing to do is to keep the extra supply in the US to lower prices. Voters don't really see the long term economic benefits of free trade, but they do see that their prices at the pump go down immediately by keeping oil in the US, so it's hard for them to want to give it up even though it hurts them eventually. Furthermore, this just makes the oil price artificially lower and encourages people to waste more, which is bad for the environment. &gt; Nationalizing these reserves can also help us shift toward green energy by using the revenue to develop green energy tech and eventually reducing output without having to worry about a profit motive. I think the opposite is true. If you look at countries with nationalized oil schemes, they often prioritize their oil companies over other forms of innovation. Right now the US would profit just as much or more from a new green energy company. But if they own oil companies, they would lose significant government revenue if new green technology replaced their oil investments. This creates an incentive to make developing green energy more difficult, as Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia have done. Furthermore, it favors American companies and ideas, even if innovative foreign companies can extract more oil for less cost with less waste. Private companies have an incentive to fire as many people as possible to keep costs down. Politicians who lead government firms have an incentive to hire as many people (who become their supporters) as possible. This leads to a lot of dead weight and inefficiency. Instead of getting fired (short term pain) and moving on to more productive jobs (long term pain) government oil company jobs encourage innovative and hard working people to stay",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],6.0,True,General,Power: resources

But if you are one of the people who is hurt by free trade (your job is lost) then it's not ideal for you personally. Yes, in the long run, you could develop new skills and end up with a better quality of life, but if you are already old and looking at retirement, there isn't much time to change. Plus, people don't like to change themselves. It's a lot of work to improve one's skills and well being. It's much easier to convince politicians to adopt policies that benefit you personally than it is to roll up your sleeves and do the work yourself. I'd argue that while most Americans would be better off slightly by free trade, there's a vocal minority who would be significantly worse off, at least in the short term. If 100 Americans would get 10 extra happiness points from free trade, that means there would be 1000 happiness points. But if 10 Americans lose 100 points each, that's a 1000 point loss too. It's true that you would greatly improve the lives of the many people living in poverty in countries that would get new jobs as well, but American politicians are elected to improve the lives of Americans, not of impoverished people worldwide (unless that's what Americans want them to do). Furthermore, if you have a very comfortable hot tub and a freezing swimming pool, if you remove the barrier between them, all you get is one cold swimming pool. You didn't really improve the lives of the people in the pool, but you made everyone in the hot tub less comfortable too.

Since then, literally billions of vaccines have been given without incident. Even the most skeptical, but intelligent person can find ample evidence that they are safe and incredibly valuable. The only people who doubt vaccines today are incredibly uneducated and ignorant people. I don't mean that as an insult.

At that point, it isn't a matter of understanding, it's a matter of trust. What color is the sky? You can go outside and see that it is blue. But, lets say you are blind. You've never seen the sky, and barely understand the concept of color at all. The only way you can find out is if you ask someone else. If you dad says that the sky is blue, and your friend says the sky is neon green, who is telling the truth? You trust your dad, but what if he says the sky changes color? One day he says it's light blue, then later that evening he says it looks reddish-orange, then that night he says it's black. What if he once screwed with you when you were a kid as a joke. Do you still trust him? Scientists don't have to rely on trust. If they are skeptical, they can just design an experiment for themselves. In fact, there is a big incentive to do so because if a scientist can disprove a major theory, there is fame and fortune, and Nobel Prizes to be had. But most of them have looked at the idea critically, and decided there isn't any evidence. Modern anti-vaccine activists simply don't have the understanding to do the same.

And many of those people went to better colleges and got better grades. Just getting a high school degree was good enough when 90% of people just got a high school degree. But when over half of people get a bachelor's or higher, you have to be even better than them if you want to make more money than the average person. A hundred years ago, it was really hard to be the plump girl because food was scarce. Only the top 5-10% of women could get enough food to be curvy. In a world when every random girl can stuff herself with fast food, the new status symbol is being thin. Only the top 5-10% of women can maintain a low weight.

You might argue that this is a regional problem, but the numbers don't support this argument. * Texas, another boarder state right next to New Mexico has an 86% graduation rate while Arizona has a 78% rate. * All of Nevada's neighbors come in at least 10 percentage points higher than it does. * All of DC's neighbors come in at least 20 percentage points higher than DC. Based on this information, I'd say that it is a reasonable conclusion that access to education and socioeconomic factors play significant roles in determining outcomes. It is unfair to say that there is equal opportunity when rates vary so much between states with similar populations.

"The argument: 'Things like schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, etc. exist in all countries, and they are perceived to be negative in all cultures. Psychiatry is taught at medical schools around the world, and many psychiatrists move to different countries to practice. If psychiatry is driven by cultural values, how do you explain Indian trained psychiatrists practicing in the US, or American trained psychiatrists practicing in sub-saharan Africa? If you are licensed as a psychiatrist in any European Union country (with at least four years of training), you are automatically licensed to practice in all EU countries. If psychiatry were dependent on culture, this would not be possible. &gt; For this reason there should be completely different psychiatries for each culture or philosophical position that would mandate different approaches and thus there should be accreditation institutions for all of these different psychiatries as opposed to having a single one that enforces the values of the leadership onto everyone. Technically, in the EU, there are 28 (soon to be 27 since Brexit) different accreditation bodies. There is one for each member country. They have the option of taking different philosophical positions, but for the most part, they all agree about which is the best one. As much as it's maligned, psychiatry is clinical medicine. It's a science and an art with best practices that apply to every country around the world. The same applies to psychiatry in countries beyond the EU. It's why psychiatric journals receive submissions from countries as diverse as Japan, South Africa, India, China, Argentina, Brazil, the US, Germany, Russia, etc. They are all contributing to the same body of literature and basing their clinical practices on that literature. Furthermore, many studies are repeated in cultures around the world before they are accepted. For example, the study that dispelled the notion that being transgender is a mental health disorder was first done in Mexico, published in a British journal, and is being repeated in India, Brazil, France, Lebanon, and South Africa. Based on the results it will be reclassified in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases and the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

"The argument: 'I think this represents a false equivalency. A militant Muslim blows up buildings. A militant Christian shoots up abortion centers. A militant atheist complains about religion. There is a big difference between how far people with these varying views are willing to go. In politics, a big part of the difference is that a very liberal person is called a ""bleeding heart."" Like Jesus Christ (who had a bleeding heart) these liberals are excessively sympathetic to the a plight of a person or group of people. They are too empathetic in a sense. On the flipside, conservatives see the world as a difficult place where someone else is always trying to hurt you. It's up to you to protect you and your family's well being. Bleeding heart liberals threaten violence only to protect the weak. Conservatives threaten violence to protect themselves. So if a liberal wants to kill Trump or Trump supporters, the idea is that they want to protect gays, minorities, immigrants, women, handicapped people, veterans, etc. from a powerful white majority group. Conservatives threaten violence against those same groups to protect themselves, their families, their jobs, their religion, etc. These groups have a fundamentally different worldview. Liberals are too nice, to the point of being taken advantage of. Trump supporters call them cucks, who are men that allow other men to have sex with their wives. Conservatives are more headstrong, to the point of hurting others. That's why Clinton fans call Trump supporters ignorant Nazis (who were authoritarian nationalists who hurt other people because of their race/religion to protect their interests and pride). You can certainly argue that hardcore liberals are as annoying, misguided, and foolish as hardcore conservatives, but it's the wrong characterization to say they are equally violent. Liberals tend to be doves (support peace) and conservatives tend to be hawks (support war) to the extent that it's one of the main ways how historians classify which group was left wing and right wing for a given historical period.'.

"The argument: 'Say you are an evil rich person and you hate lazy, entitled poor people. You want to give them the bare minimum needed in order to survive, but if they want anything nice or luxurious they need to pay extra or work harder. What is the best food to give them? Corn is really easy to grow. You can turn it into high fructose corn syrup, which is really easy to transport and use. You can easily make into Coke and Little Debbies, which never expire or go bad. These products are high in calories and dirt cheap. On the other hand, fresh fruits and veggies are relatively expensive. They cost more to grow, they are tougher to transport, and expire relatively quickly. Sure, corn syrup is less healthy. It makes you fat and tired. It sets of a chain reaction where feeling tired means you eat convenience foods that make you too tired to cook anything with veggies, which means you eat more convenience foods. But why change it? The goal is to provide poor people with the bare minimum, remember? And why not give them stuff that will make you rich? Large corporate farms get rich off of corn, companies like Pepsi and McDonald's get rich off of using corn syrup as an ingredient, and retailers get rich selling it. The margin on convenience food is far greater than the margin on veggies. If you give someone a dollar, and they pay you a dollar back, all you lost was the cost of producing the food. And don't forget that the first dollar comes from public taxes whereas the money ends up in the private owner's hands. So if your goal is to provide the bare minimum, then the convenience foods are the way to go. It doesn't help the person who has to eat them very much, but it keeps them alive, which was the only goal. Plus, people will blame them for buying junk instead of you for selling it. As long as you don't have to pay for their healthcare, this is the way to go (once you add in the cost of paying for diabetes, heart disease, etc., it becomes way cheaper to give them healthy food in the first place.) The point I'm trying to make is that the food you provide really depends on your perspective and what the purpose of food stamps is.

The amount of technology that has sprung forth from his innovation (it's an oversimplification to say his, but it certainly was a huge catalyst). Poetry, philosophy, history doesn't bring the ROI.

We can't make business or the rich pay, that's not how they get rich. We make the middle and lower class pay via taxes - to high school. Then, by using attrition (high school drop out is around 30% - higher if you measure it like the Japanese), you lower the amount of entrants into college. Only 30% get a bachelor's, so through attrition, you get closer to who can innovate. It used to be a person could pay cheaply for college by getting a job on the back end. 100 yrs ago we only needed people educated to an 8th grade level. Now we need a bachelor's level. The trouble is cost. It's easy to tax for K-12. It's expensive, but really only because of the disadvantaged, labor, and monetization. College is a different story. Here you have to pay for a whole multitude more: sports, professors, materials ( can't innovate without the actual materials).

Clearly this construction has a biological basis, and our very nature as social animals basically forces us to see things in patterns, groups and constructions. It is how we are built.

"The argument: 'In film theory and criticism, there is a thing called the *auteur* theory, which is the idea that highly creative directors have such a prevailing influence over their productions that we can look at them as auteurs, or authors, in the way that we would talk about the author of a novel, even though a film is a collaborative work of many hundreds of individuals. For example, even though Alfred Hitchcock didn't always work with the same producers, screenwriters, or actors, we can find similarities in a Hitchcock film because his creative influence was so strong. He picked his stories, came up with ideas, hired personnel, cast actors, etc. The auteur theory states that we should view Hitchcock as the ""author"" of his movies in the way that Hemingway is the author of his novels. Not all directors are auteurs, and not all auteurs are directors. Lucas is actually a really great example of auteur theory because even though he didn't even direct OR write Empire Strikes Back, his *influence* still remains in the story, concepts, and images. The problem a lot of people have with the auteur theory is the exact problem you're having which is that, at the end of the day, yes, maybe there is one person who has the most creative input, but there are few films in which *only one person* has ALL the creative input, and placing importance on one person as the ""author"" takes away from all of the people working on the movie. Your view isn't just about STAR WARS, therefore, but pretty much all movies, ever. If you actually read up on the auteur theory, though, you'll find that the core idea is not **many influential filmmakers are the single creative source of a film** and more **if we HAD to point to a single ""author"" in order to make film conveniently analogous with novels and paintings that traditionally are the work of a single artist, that artist WOULD HAVE TO BE the director or producer that has the most creative control.** Therefore, working under auteur theory, we HAVE to point to Lucas, even if we acknowledge we are working under a flawed way of thinking.

States always have had [moral legitimacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6b70TUbdfs) its only recently they separated form churches they used to be the word of god to people. People believe they are obligated to pay taxes and in many cases proud to do so, so the state is rather small but gains alot of money, this system wouldn't work with 3% of the population just dodging taxes. Totalitarian states generally need to teach people to feel morally obligated to report their neighbors for minor crimes like owning a banned book, that level of cultural acceptance doesn't appear over night. &gt;The second issue is what has you convinced that humans are organized enough to have a society like this.

"The argument: '1) they do update them.

Also the ti nspire; and a few Casio models as well. 3) most importantly schools need consistency, the reason the ti84 doesn't update constantly and the reason schools choose one calculator is because they don't want to train people to use 50 different calculator interfaces in order to help their students or have to waste time explaining each calculators process for preforming an operation so everyone in class can keep up. It's a huge waste of time. 4) testing needs dumb calculators. Many exams don't even allow ti84s because you can program them to preform function beyond their factory capabilities. As well as store notes in them. For test that require graphing calculators I've seen cases where proctors will watch as each student factory resets their calculators to prevent this. With modern trends this could become much more difficult as calculators become Internet connected with browsing capabilities. So in conclusion, yes it's reasonable to restrict what you can take into a test. Because proctors need to know the capabilities of the devices student bring in. As for day to day classroom use I have never seen a student asked to leave for their choice of calculator or asked to not use it that would be ridiculous. But for the students that do chose non approved calculators the standard that I have seen is that that student is on their own when it comes to knowing how to use it where as the instructor will walk a class through a process on the supported calculator.

"The argument: 'I highly doubt this person wants to ""shut down all intelligent discourse and reasoned discussion just so that he or she has a captive, silenced audience for his or her emotional venting"" what she likely wants is to actually, finally be *heard*. Often, people who complain about the status quo are shot down and told they're just playing the race card, or hypersensitive, or need to relax because it's just a joke. Just look at this: &gt; When students tried to tell him about their painful personal experiences as students of color on campus, **he responded by making more arguments for free speech.** That isn't a debate, it's shutting down their point of view. Now, is she necessarily taking the best route? I don't think so, personally I would have done things much differently. I am not strictly defending her actions, I am explaining her frustration. For instance, look at the tweets in that Washington Post article, they're not intelligence discourse or debate. They're railing against someone for having and expressing those feelings. Maybe if these people felt that people were listening to them, they would feel better about debate. Because debate and intelligent discourse is a two-way street, not one person being shut down just because they have feelings.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

Or at the very least, they're under the impression that they are. Take Global Warming. On the surface, it seems so simple. The planet is warming, we're dumping a not-insignificant amount of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. This will have drastic effects on the environment, we ignore it at our peril.

How can we be sure it is even happening in the first place, who stands to gain from it happening and have they infiltrated the narrative? Now, I am not saying that this is the most logical or reasonable response to climate change, I am just saying that to someone on the inside of that mindset, their view *looks* logical and reasonable. When we say something is ""logical"" all we mean is that our conclusion follows from our premises. Furthermore, throughout history there have been loads of similar examples. I am not sure when you think the height of American Politics was, but we kept slavery as an institution despite the very principals this country was founded on because logically it didn't make sense to cut the legs out from under our capacity as a society to make a whole lot of money and reasonably it seemed like black people were simply better suited to slavery. Or maybe you're thinking of the enlightened America where we almost destroyed the world lest it fall in the hands of a different ideology.

One can say they don't identify as male/female and go in there. No one will know they're lying. Why is this a problem, exactly? You have three bathrooms, one for men, one for women, and one that is unisex that can be used by anyone regardless of identity. I mean personally I think it's just much, much easier to not put a third bathroom in public spaces and just allow people to use the bathroom they most identify with but I'm not sure what is wrong with this third option. &gt; If we make everything unisex, maybe 5% of people are happier because they don't feel awkward using the bathroom, but rape/molestation would likely go up.

You'll learn to spot good parts of wikipedia, where they provide lots of information, with sources for all of it (which should of course be taught to double check), or you learn to see information with no sources on it, so you'll know to be careful with using that information. It would be best to double check whatever it said on other websites. But your teachers/professors aren't interested in learning about how to properly use wikipedia - they're interested in having the actual source of the information you're presenting. See how one of your points here is talking about ""information with no sources on it""? Yeah, ignore those because the information that does have sources on it will refrence the source - which is the actual source of the information and the one you should include in your bibliography. Wikipedia is a good learning tool, but it is far from perfect or unbiased. So just use it to find sources instead of citing it directly.

The problem is that there are trans actors who aren't being given a shot to play a role they would resonate with. Let's examine your NPH example, it is (IIRC) rather rare for an openly gay man to get a straight role in Hollywood or on TV. In fact, when HIMYM I seem to recall that NPH wasn't even out yet. Because once an actor comes out they tend to get type cast as only gay characters (and certainly not as leading characters). [Here's](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/homophobia-in-hollywood-why-gay-movie-stars-still-cant-come-out-of-the-closet-8455751.html) an interesting article discussing the phenomenon. I would imagine that this difficulty extends to trans actors. How often do you think Laverne Cox is going to get a role where she plays a cis woman? Or be the leading actress in a movie? Most people getting leading actor roles are straight white men. That's why nobody has a similar issue when a non-straight man plays a straight one. I'm sure the straight white men who might have otherwise played Barney in HIMYM could just pursue one of the millions of other roles available to them. But for many minorities in acting they're forced to either play their stereotype in a bit part or not work at all.

"The argument: '&gt; Black History Month was no doubt created as an 'apology' of sorts for slavery in America. No, Black History Month was created because the mainstream history that was taught in schools was primarily white history. That's it, it isn't an apology for slavery (as though dedicating a month to your history could be an apology for that sort of thing) it isn't anything but an acknowledgement that *most history* most people in this country learn about is white history. So it's a chance for schools to focus on a seperated aspect of history that usually goes ignored. I'm not sure why your tangent on genocides is relevant, Hitler didn't exclusively target Jews - and his crimes are just better highlighted in history because Americans take a very ""good vs. evil"" vibe from WWII - not so much with the Cold War. &gt; My point is, racism is taken much too seriously and Black History Month is a perfect example. Should we not take racism seriously?

It was well-established that after losing her pilot's licence she became a dock worker, then helps out on the Sulaco with it, and finally uses it to be on par with the queen.

"The argument: 'After a bit of a search I found the word that I was looking for. ""Street smart"" is a [hackneyed](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hackneyed) phrase. Just about every word (or phrase) that gains popularity loses a bit of it's specificity as it's adopted by a larger group of users. I'd like to address a couple of your claims: 1) The phrases ""street smart"" and ""book smart"" are used by people who are of above-average intelligence too. I've heard a friend of mine excuse a gaffe of his because he didn't have ""street smarts."" It goes both ways. People will use these phrases to make themselves appear superior, or less inferior, no matter what the situation is. Nobody wants to feel bad and they'll use whatever they can to massage their ego. 2) /u/dasilence was correct, in my opinion, by relating ""street smart"" with worldliness. The current usage has little to do with living (or hustling) on the streets. Given that a lot of people who are living in the streets are unhappy attests to the fact that having ""street smarts,"" if defined as the ability to survive on the streets, is not a skill of tremendous value. It can be developed, just like everything else. And some people will be better at it than others. A lot of people have come to be on the streets because of poverty or financial mismanagement, which may have been prevented if they had more ""book smarts."" Worldliness seems a much better fit for how the phrase is currently used. Edit: Corrected a spelling mistake. I was sleepy when I wrote this.'.

"The argument: '&gt; grammar nazis seem to take pleasure in being ""right"" I think they'd prefer that you use the word *correct* instead of ""right."" (Sorry!) ******************* Proper use of grammar helps to clarify what a person is saying. Especially on the internet where people often cannot see each other's faces and bodies the words become more important than ever. The way human beings are set up, at least biologically, is that a lot of information is received non-verbally - so through body language, tone, etc. In fact, some estimates say that interpersonal communication is dominated by non-verbal cues! That's pretty amazing to think about. Back to grammar: Better grammar, better communication. Take a look at [this example](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/serial-comma) of the oxford comma: &gt; Here’s a sentence that could mean different things with and without the final comma: Rebecca was proud of her new muffin recipes: blueberry, peanut butter and chocolate chip and coconut. &gt;&gt; Without a serial comma, you can’t be sure whether the last recipe is a combination of peanut butter and chocolate chip or a combination of chocolate chip and coconut.

"The argument: 'I like holidays! Christmas, Easter, etc. don't hold much sway with an atheist, but this sort of holiday I can really get behind. And it really matters to someone like me who isn't religious and doesn't celebrate the religious holidays with a lot of enthusiasm. I feel like I'm missing out on some serious fun, you know. &gt; I think that if people want to honor someone special in their lives, then it would be more meaningful if it wasn't part of an established group celebration. I welcome an opportunity to honor my mother, I do it to celebrate her invaluable contributions in my life. I try to make it fun for her. It's also very convenient for her to know in advance that I'll likely spend the day with her and we'll do fun things together, so she gets to plan ahead. Yes, I look at the cards and gifts and become cynical; oh, it's all so commercial now and blah blah. But fuck that! It's a great thing to celebrate, and if I bring the right attitude to it then that's all that matters to me. And although it would be great, in an ideal world, to always be grateful and expressive towards one's parents it just doesn't happen, does it? Not for me. I appreciate having a couple of days every year to have a chance to reflect on the relationship I have with my parents. It's unfortunate that everyone does not have that, but that's neither here nor there. I don't want Christmas cancelled because of my atheism. &gt; So I think these established days of celebration rob us of a more general approach to honoring people we care for, and they remove some of the meaning beyond the sentiment by making the celebration culturally mandatory. It's only a drag if you think of it as some dreadful duty. Try to think of it as an opportunity and just enjoy it. Edit: Happy Cakeday! WOOOOH! Post a cute pic on r/aww for some Reddit love.'.

"The argument: '&gt; I don't trust putting technology inside my body. Not only does it make it easier to identify me, but nobody knows what happens when tech is in your body yet. What if there's a battery in it and it breaks and poisons you? Why would you put things inside your body? [Pacemakers](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/pace) have been around for many decades. Implantable pacemakers have [existed for over five decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker#Implantable), and though they weren't very reliable at the beginning, they've been very helpful to thousands of people since then. I've known someone who had a pacemaker inserted that extended his life for over a decade. The reason I've brought up pacemakers is because batteries were a problem with the early pacemakers and doctors and engineers designed a better battery case - many of the problems have been dealt with already. This is always the case with technology, it seems too radical to be truly safe and then it is. Imagine the case where everyone has a small chip implanted inside them (optionally) that contains their medical history, allergies, special needs etc. all in one place. If there's ever an emergency the doctor would have access to a lot of useful information that could save a person's life. Yes, there is a chance for theft of information. But does that outweigh the benefits? What about when this kind of technology becomes wide-spread and the drawbacks pale in comparison to the benefits? There will be some mistakes at the beginning, but once you include a larger number of people the advantages will outweigh the risks.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'I'm glad your son is well! But I don't think the salts were the reason that he got better. I'll try to explain a few things that I think may have happened. Please tell me if they make sense. 1) I looked up [Schüssler Salts](http://www.schusslersalts.com/wcm/mb/schuessler/en-en/how-schuessler-salts-work/index.html) on the internet because I hadn't heard of them before. Unfortunately, the description of the way that these salts help relieve illnesses is basically magic. The page that I linked to claims that the salts may work through the ""Activation of self-healing powers."" This should put you on your guard right away. Language like this that does not clearly state the method that the treatment fights a disease is basically not trustworthy. This claim is un-falsifiable because there's no scientific method to test magic. Basically, the body's own immune system is the self-healing it needs against the flu. The reason you and your family had a fever was *because* your immune systems were working overtime to fight off the flu. It's a simplified version, but pretty accurate. 2) There's often a language problem related to these allopathic treatments. The problem is internal, and there's some good research that language also has a lot to do with the placebo effect. Okay, you say that you gave your son a ""medicine"" and it made him better. Fine, but if it had made his symptoms worse, you probably would not have blamed it on the ""medicine"" that you gave him. It would have been the flu's fault. Do you see? You've primed yourself to accept that it works by calling it a medicine in the first place. If it works then the ""medicine"" works, if it doesn't then it wasn't good enough. The option that it didn't do anything at all isn't given much weight in your internal cause-and-effect summary. Personally, I prefer the word ""intervention"" for any medical treatment - pills, surgery, whatever. 3) As I understand it, there is no ""cure"" for the flu",[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],1.0,True,Gaming,"Self-direction: action,Conformity: interpersonal,Benevolence: caring"

(I know it isn't Germany, but it was the best I could find and I think the analysis will still be applicable.) The incidence rate of dog bites among children (which is your main concern) is 0.5 per 1000, which is very small but still worth analyzing more thoroughly. Well, it's the one year-olds who are at the highest risk of bites, and 82% of the dogs were familiar to the children, i.e. family pets. Most one year-olds aren't walking around outside unsupervised, they're with their parents when in public, usually being wheeled around everywhere.

Most games are low-scoring affairs, including lots of *almosts* and *near-misses*. A lot of sports popular in America have lots of constant action, the NBA is a prime example of this. It's the difference b/w a summer action movie and a sleek thriller. In soccer, the scorers try to put the ball through the goalposts again and again, and get denied again and again. And it happens because it really is a team sport. Although there are many sublime soccer players a very good defence is hard to get through for even the most talented scorers. This is often highlighted in the difference b/w club soccer and national soccer. Barcelona, a very successful club, owes a lot of its success to its ability to sign a lot of the best players in the world. (American sports have salary caps.) When it comes to national teams, the same superstars don't do as well because they often don't have the same support as they do in club soccer. The extra time after the 90' mark is to make up for the time lost due to stoppages during the game: when referees penalize players, time lost due to fouls, etc. Those extra minutes are often thrilling.

Women can vote, have more control over their minds and bodies than in the past, are more economically mobile, etc. The list goes on and on. But just as racism is officially illegal, racist thoughts haven't disappeared from society. The same is true for sexism, a lot of it is unacknowledged and some of the people who are sexist aren't even aware of their prejudices. That's the sort of thing that the current wave of feminists is trying to highlight, that ingrained bias. And changing people's way of thinking requires a different approach than enacting laws, hence the ""loudness"" of some feminists - that' what irks you isn't it? Just to prove that sexism does exist I'll show you something. You'd probably think that scientists (college-educated, experienced) wouldn't be biased against women, but you'd be wrong. Take a look at [this article that discusses sexism in science.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/unofficial-prognosis/study-shows-gender-bias-in-science-is-real-heres-why-it-matters/) It's an excellent study that controls for a very large number of variables.

"The argument: 'You've come very close to answering your own question. I'll try to show you the only part that you're missing. &gt; I believe it is fair to say that everything is what you make it. This is true. Depression does occur in the mind. Since different people have slightly different brains the traumas or other actions that trigger depression vary in their intensity. You were able to rebound from the loss of your father quickly, but another person -- who has a mind that s/he did not really ""choose"" -- may react very differently. And there may be some things that you may be unable to handle that others can. Biological and environmental factors play a prominent role in who gets the short straw. Let's move on... &gt; How such an intelligent person could succumb to these ailments every single day and essentially ""lose the battle with their own mind."" &gt;&gt; The only necessary component to beat these afflictions is thinking. The problem is that depression directly affects a person's capacity to think clearly. Depressed people are rarely kind to themselves. And the mind ties itself up in ways that make it very difficult to escape the pattern(s) of thought that cause the suffering. Even when people realize that they need to take action it's very difficult to do so because depression often hampers the ability to take that action. You see? It's a vicious cycle! &gt; There are no other outside factors or influences that affect our psyche, emotions, feelings, thoughts etc, and the afflicted I have spoken to are all aware of this concept. That isn't true. There are [ways to treat depression](http://www.cmha.ca/mental_health/children-and-depression/) that do not rely solely on the depressed person's capacity to think! There's talk therapy like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, which can be extremely helpful. There's medication. There are support groups, etc. The point is that some outside support is necessary to help break the patterns --both mental *and* physical-- that depression imposes on a person. Once those are in place it becomes a lot easier to for the person to keep improving and get back to where they want to",[1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],1.0,True,Gaming,"Self-direction: thought,Stimulation,Achievement"

"The argument: 'The promises are a part of politics themselves. When campaigning, two opponents will often say things that set them apart. If everything was to be extremely realistic there would be no way for people to realistically differentiate the *values* of the candidates. Let's say Candidate #1 wants to reduce the number of troops abroad, while Candidate #2 wants to increase the number of troops. Realistically, they'd probably be able to achieve the same thing. But, through their promises, the voters get an idea of where the candidates stand on the issues. And that's very important. Politics is, to a significant degree, about aspirations. Promises reveal the different visions that candidates have, and what they'd like to achieve (or which direction they'd like to go) when they have power. So it does have some practical utility.

"The argument: 'The reason I like watching movies in cinemas is because I can be a part of a larger audience and watching the movie becomes a communal experience that I share with strangers. The two types of movies I like to watch with a large crowd are action movies and kiddy movies. I even [wrote about this on reddit](https://redd.it/3dbsds) many months ago. I went to watch Inside Out and there was a kid in the audience who was reacting so adorably to what was going on that it added a whole new level of enjoyment to my experience. And watching Mad Max: Fury Road was also a great experience. When some crazy shit happened everyone went ""Ooooooooh!"" and I did the same thing. It was fantastic! It can be a bit of a risk, but the payoff is often worth it. Oh, like when I watched Spotlight. For whatever reason I was alone that afternoon and I watched the movie by myself. There were times when the audience gasped together -- in collective surprise -- when something terrible was revealed during the investigation. That also added to the sense of sharing an important and revealing experience with others. I got to witness their empathy and that sort of stuff isn't available at the same level at home. edit: grammar...'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'There are a few things that you should keep in mind before you make your decision: 1) You're 22 years old. Since you've been suffering for many years I think you've probably read up about the facts of your disease. Statistically, you are at a *dangerous* age when it comes to suicide. Most young people who think about (or attempt) suicide at your age grow out of it as they mature. Your case is certainly severe --multiple visits to hospitals, many therapists, etc-- but if you take your own life now then you forego any chance of getting better. When coupled with the fact that you're not really getting ""better"" by committing suicide, it's probably a good idea to wait it out and let your brain get older before you make the decision. The decision itself is still your own, but thinking of the consequences before you make your decision is always better, isn't it? 2) Speaking of consequences, here's something that you should think of too. You feel that you need to stay alive so that other people don't get hurt. Like it or not, that is how it is. To be really consistent, you have to weigh your pain against the pain that losing you would cause your family, friends, acquaintances, and on and on. Then realize that their pain, though it will lose its edge, will remain with them for their whole life. You won't be there so it won't affect you, but the pain will stay with them for as long as they live. This is a consequentialist's argument. Does removing the pain that you're experiencing outweigh the pain that will arise from your absence? Again, the choice is your own, but I'm trying to add considerations for you so that you might hopefully change your view about the ""right"" you have. 3) One more thing, you spoke of the freedom to choose. Well, that's a weak argument. No, every choice is not available to every person. The choices available are the ones you consider, the ones that you can see or are made available to you. When you were choosing which college to go to, did you consider going to Peru and majoring in Agricultural Studies? I doubt it.

"The argument: '&gt; But where do you draw the line? Who decides where the censorship stops and speech is free again? This sort of absolutist view is fine in theory, but not very useful in practice. Some limits on freedom of speech are valid and useful. In the US, speech that encourages imminent violence is deemed outside the protections of the 1st amendment. Imagine what would happen if a racist organization encouraged its members to go and slaughter a minority that it dislikes and hid behind the protections of ""free speech"" despite inciting and encouraging violence against people. It would be chaos. Very often it's the courts that decide what is and isn't free speech. If you want you can take a quick look [here](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/95-815.pdf) for more information. I'd also like to add that spreading false information is often punishable under libel laws.

Now it is true that species like pine, cedar, or juniper are better for this than palm trees are but palms are better than not having a sound barrier. Also Date Palms, coconut palms, and a few others do produce food that we harvest and eat. These may not be the types that are being planted by roads but they could be. 3) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washingtonia_filifera is native to California. Palms are also desert plants. They in general require less water than most other plants which makes the perfectly suited for the Southern California climate, if not better suited than many native plants. (Edit: The native California Palm also does produce an edible fruit which can be eaten raw, roasted, or dried ground into flour and was a staple in the Native American diet of the region.) 4) This is a matter of opinion.

In the above case if it was a pure accident then no crime has been committed at all.

"The argument: 'The ethnic group Palestinians are a nomadic Arabs tribal group that moved into the region that is now Palestine after the Ottoman Empire took over the region. The modern use of the term only applies to this ethnic group. So for any modern day person to call him Palestinian is erroneous. Additionally the region that Jesus was born in was called Judea at the time of his birth by the Jews, and the region he was raised in was called Galilee by the Jews. So no, the locals did not call it Palestine. The name Palestine for the region originated with the Assyrians spread via trade from them to the Babylonians and then passed down linguistically to the descendants of both groups, the ancestors of the Arab ethnic groups that eventually formed the Ottoman Empire. The name would have come to the region in waves as the Holy land was often conquered but it was used by the conquerors, not the locals for it until the Ottomans took over and Arabs became the dominant ethnic group and language of the region. Edit: The Egyptians originally called it the land of the Hyksos as they were the people that came from that direction that they went to war with. Later it appears that the name Palestine entered their records for the region via trade and war with Assyria. The Canaanites called the region ""Canaan"". Edit 2: The ancient Hebrew word connected to the term Palestine is actually the term Philistine.

"The argument: 'So there's a lot of good research on the ""welfare trap"" though not using that term. The term that's usually used is what's called the ""implicit marginal tax rate."" Essentially, that's the rate at which taxes + reduced benefits cut away at new earned income. One of the reasons for consolidating a lot of conditional programs into one unconditional or less conditional program is so that we can make sure that the sum of those fall-offs doesn't add up to a situation where people are better off not getting slightly higher paying jobs. So for instance, if you look at some of the bigger safety net programs in the US: Rental assistance falls off at a pretty consistent 1/3 of your income. The EITC falls off at about 40% during the fall off period. Food stamps also fall off, but I don't remember the precise rate (and IIRC it can vary by state a bit.) [This paper](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/11-15-2012-MarginalTaxRates.pdf) (PDF warning) from the US Congressional Budget Office provides a good illustration. In particular, check out the summary fig 1 on page 6 of the PDF. The disposable income line is just incredibly flat for a single parent with one child from $0 income to $30,000 income.

As such, the argument he makes is one that centers around real world applications and results, not an an abstract right to free speech consequences be damned. Mill makes three core points about why the silencing of an opinion with which one disagrees is a bad idea. * **You don't know whether the idea you hold up as true could be wrong.** We aren't infallible. It is very, very, very unlikely this is true of the people on subs like coontown. But is it totally impossible? No. * **Even if the ideas on the other side are wrong, they may contain an element of truth.** I think this is where the comparison to something like climate change is apt. The fact of vocal criticism has, on several occasions, pointed out meaningful flaws in climate science that might not otherwise have come to light. Moreover, even if the central premises of climate change existing, being caused by CO2 and human emissions thereof are not in material dispute, that is not the end of the question. There is legitimate uncertainty over the magnitude of change in temperature in respect to CO2 concentration, which is a big question in respect to the degree of justified human response. * **Even if the ideas of the other side are *completely* wrong, contesting them has value.** If something becomes received wisdom that can't ever be debated or challenged, in many cases it will be poorly understood by those advocating for it. We see this in respect to many popular political dogmas today, where people will profess to support free speech, and then support all sorts of censorship.

Not really. The main focus of the crisis was actually the securitization of very poor quality mortgages and their sale to non-retail-bank financial institutions. Outfits like Countrywide and IndyMac, as well as investment banks in the securitization business like Lehman Bros and Bear Stearns, as well as insurers selling credit default swaps like AIG were the more directly responsible parties. &gt;Now that the banks have returned to their pre-crisis level, the government should force them to split into smaller banks to prevent the failure of any one bank from being Your sentence cut off here, but I'm gonna assume the last word is something like ""catastrophic."" This is a bad idea for a few reasons: * It does not take a lot of ""bigness"" to be catastrophic. The catastrophe comes from owing a lot of people a lot more money than you can reasonably be expected to pay back. And even a not-huge institution like AIG was able to fall into that trap. They sold enormous quantities of insurance against defaults they thought were unlikely and uncorrelated. When those defaults turned out to be both likely and correlated, AIG suddenly was on the hook for vast sums of money that they couldn't pay, and thereby posed a systemic risk, even though they were only one of many insurance companies before the crisis. * A small number of banks are easier to regulate.

"The argument: 'There are a number of issues with this: * It would make the United States _much_ poorer. One of the big changes implemented by the US Constitution was the interstate commerce clause, which gave the Federal government authority over trade between states. Without this, you would end up with state borders having tariffs, embargoes, and other protective measures. These laws are highly inefficient and would balkanize the US from one big economy to many small economies, which in sum would produce far fewer real goods and services, and therefore have a poorer populace. * It would be a disaster for civil liberties. One of the big things that conservatives and liberals dislike about the Federal government is the relative aggression with which the Federal courts have enforced the bill of rights. (See: gay marriage on the right, and _Citizens United_ on the left). If left to the state governments, it is likely the relatively libertarian compromise made by the Federal courts would be undone, and we'd see a vast diminishing of the rights of free speech, freedom from search and seizure, and meaningful equal protection and due process protections. * There are better reforms. There are definite problems with the American system right now, but balkanizing it to the states is not a very good solution. Much better would be structural reform at the Federal level to adopt a more parliamentary system where multiple parties could be competitive and it would generally require some level of compromise and aisle crossing to form a government. Most other western democracies do this, and it works pretty well.'. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

As long as South Carolina wants to peaceably remain part of the United States it should not fly the flag that stems from the time they seceded and started a war rather than be governed by a President who was duly elected, but whom they disliked. * **Slavery:** As you say, the war was about South Carolina and other southern states keeping slavery against the perceived threat of the Lincoln administration. As long as South Carolina does not want to reinstate slavery, it should not fly a flag that symbolizes that. * **Racism:** Since the war, the flag has largely been the provenance of racists intent on subjugating black people. It was not widely used until the Civil Rights Movement picked up steam in the 1950s. And during that revival, it was the symbol of those who opposed racial equality. [See here](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/why-is-the-flag-still-there/396431/) for a history of the flag's revival. As long as South Carolina does not wish to engage in racial subjugation, it should not fly a flag that symbolizes that. There is good cause for the flag to be in a museum. But its placement on the grounds of the Capitol, enforced by statute, is not there for historical reasons. It is there for symbolic reasons.

"The argument: '&gt;Education is an investment in the goodwill and future of the nation/planet/humanity and should be not made to profit off. Education is a service provided to the people being educated. It gives them new skills, knowledge, experiences, and connections. It has beneficial effects on others as well, but the large majority of the benefit goes to the specific people who were educated. &gt;If education is not the primary objective of an educational institute, the institute may very well jeopardize it in hopes of making more money. How is this different from other businesses? The primary objective of a farmer is to make money, which they do by selling food they grow. A school can do the same. Indeed, if they want to make money long term, they're better off generally providing good education. Unless there's something else in play. &gt;Furthermore, tuition is usually higher, as compared to non-for-profit universities, making it harder for people of lower socioeconomic statuses to attend it. Now we're getting to the nitty gritty of why most private for-profit colleges in the US are terrible. And they are terrible. For profit colleges exist because the US government will give large amounts of money to any US citizen with a pulse for college. The tuition they charge is generally exactly enough to maximize the aid a poor person can get from the government (loans+grants). They exist to milk off the government, and their students are basically just a means to the end of exploiting government programs.

"The argument: 'You need to clarify what you mean when you say it ""should be allowed."" There are two possible veins to it, and its not clear which you mean: * **Should it be allowed legally?** Yes, clearly. Free speech protection in the US is incredibly robust. You can say far worse things than are said in *Book of Mormon* and be free from any legal reprecussions. See, for instance, [*Snyder v. Phelps*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2981429692939250360), which held that Fred Phelps and his crazy church could not be held liable for picketing funerals of soldiers with signs saying things such as: &gt;""God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,"" ""America is Doomed,"" ""Don't Pray for the USA,"" ""Thank God for IEDs,"" ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers,"" ""Pope in Hell,"" ""Priests Rape Boys,"" ""God Hates Fags,"" ""You're Going to Hell,"" and ""God Hates You."" If that's allowed, Book of Mormon is definitely OK. * **Should it be socially acceptable?** This really depends on the power dynamics of society. So all the stuff that Phelps said above is legally OK, but basically totally socially unacceptable in the US. Nobody likes the Westboro Baptist Church, and they're subject to derision and scorn. In general, I think that such derision should be reserved for people who are (in this context) attacking a religion or culture who are marginalized and unable to defend themselves. In the case of Mormonism in the US today, I don't think that's the case. Mormons are not subject to legal repression, and Mormons are able to hold positions of substantial power. Indeed, especially in Utah, there is probably more concern of Mormon oppression of non-Mormons than the reverse. Of course, dumb attacks on Mormonism should subject you to scorn for being dumb.

"The argument: 'The pre-17th amendment scheme did not greatly enhance state power and was based on a mistaken idea of how politics would operate. The founders in 1787 did not think we would develop a party system, but rather thought that the principal interest groups would be states or regions of states. Their belief was that being a Virginian or a New Yorker would be the most important part of a politician's identity. They were mistaken. The overwhelming determinant of political behavior is party, not state of origin. If New York and Virginia each have one Democratic party senator, and one Republican party senator, the D-NY and D-VA senators would vote nearly in lockstep, as would the R-NY and R-VA senators, with the D-NY and R-NY senators almost constantly opposing one another. If you want senators to be true delegates of the states, as opposed to just politicians chosen by parties, you would need to have them be selected *and removed* by state governments. By being continually accountable to the state (as opposed to serving a 6 year term) they would act as a genuine representative of that state's government. They're still likely to be partisan (because states have the same parties as the feds do) but they would actually be instruments of state government. Under the pre-17th amendment scheme, a Senator picked by the Democratic party who saw the Republicans swept into power in his state 2 years later would have no reason to support the new state government, because it was not of his party.'.

"The argument: 'If you look at at cities from a sped-up zoomed-out god-like perspective, it looks very ""organic like"" - sucking in energy, growing, moving, shriveling, respiring and producing waste... The problem with a descriptive list of characteristics versus a definition is that it's all about ticking boxes about what *appears* to be exhibited *to us*, rather than trying to determine which single characteristic is the essential one that matters. So yes, a computer and a city appear to resemble a living thing - but it's fishy. For example, we can imagine, in theory, alien life forms that break each particular descriptive point, yet we would immediately identify them as being alive E.g. one that does not reproduce - reproduction, afteral, is merely how some life systems solve the problem of change/adaption, but there could be other solutions such as adapting/changing/growing yourself without children. Or one that does not have self contained metabolic processes in the traditional chemical sense, but has information about itself strewn around it's environment, shared/accessed/modified when required. A definition, however, allows you to include and exclude members, because it designates the essential characteristic that a non member lacks. For example: ""A living thing is a pattern that contains information about itself that allows it to act/change to pursue values and evade harm so that it's existence may persist existing"". Such a definition would exclude dead things that can't act to continue their existence, such as rocks. And it allows us to include certain computer actions as life-like. But you have to decide whether it's an isolated incident more similar to an avalanche of carefully placed rocks on an inertial trajectory - or whether the robot/computer/program would continue to exist by virtue of it's own actions. But being classified as a living thing is a long *long* way away from being classified as ""alive"" in the sense that an animal with a brain is alive.

"The argument: 'Have you read The Count of Monte Cristo? There's a context in which violent retribution redeems the person carrying out the violence (even if the Count took it too far). Here is another example: a wife is beaten by her husband on and off for 20 years, and it's not just her body that has gotten pummelled, but her sense of pride and individuality and independence - she becomes his slave in all things. She feels less than human. But one night, the remaining spark of independence grows into a small fire in her mind and she thinks up a horrible death for her husband, one where he awakes tied to the bedpost, and she's explaining to him the horror of what he's done, and he understands it fully, and he's screaming - in pain and in fear - for forgiveness. He's asleep. She has a needle of sedative. Perhaps there is a baby whimpering in a cot in the next room, but that's beside the point. If it was *just* an act of self-defence - then sedating the man and fleeing would be enough. But it's not enough - she wants the thousand times she backed away in fear to be reversed, to be made up for. She has a *right* to get back the power over herself that he took away. She needs to know that she is in control over him, that she won on his terms - or the rest of her life will a haunted misery anyway.

Yes, if all is identical in the two scenarios, the same effect/result happens. **So what.** The question of Free-will is *what is the cause* of that effect/result? So to disprove free-will, *you* need to prove what the cause of our decisions are. If you can prove that all your choices are predetermined by *not you* - only then you will have disproved free-will. So what is your definition of cause and effect that allows you to disprove free-will? ------------------- To me it makes sense that what we experience *as ostensibly a fact* (that we **do** have an ability to choose) takes primacy over hypotheticals (such as how free it is, in what way, whether this or that philosophy of determinism supports or contradicts it's existence). In the first instance, first hand evidence and experience - the ""given facts"" should take precedence; we know they exist in so far as much as that is what we experience. We may not know how, or in what manner they exist, just that they do. Even logical arguments must take a second seat, because their conclusions are not infallible. But *that* we experience something that feels like this or that, are the inescapable facts that can't be denied. If you want to prove that what we experience as free will is illusion your logic has to be *tight*. Show me a single case where one of your predeterminate causes - other than your reasoning ability - *must inexorably result in a specific choice*.

Obviously, for the inmate, book smarts could get you beat up and street smarts was the key to survival.

"The argument: 'We don't *just* see the world through our eyes, however, we see it through our other sensors and our brain too. And just because our eyes may be colourblind or receive partial information, it doesn't mean the end results - our beliefs about the world - are incorrect! Corrupt input does not necessitate corrupt output. Our ability to make abstractions *does* allow us to see the world as it really is (not *all* of it at every level at a time, that would be omniscient, but the part we are perceiving). That's why a completely blind person, a chinese person and an english person all have the same abstract *idea* of what a ""table"" *is*. It's only the concrete table they choose to imagine/perceive that differs - but the conceptual identity is the same. All three persons *abstract* the idea of table *from* concrete examples they have experienced - which means they discard the non essential concrete details they have experienced to create a concept of *no particular* height/length/colour/thickness, to create an abstract concept that is the same for all three people *despite* all their concrete experiences being different. And when any of these 3 people are given a new table they have *never specifically experienced before* (e.g. a flat surface 7ft off the ground made of polka dot glass with three legs) - they all agree this is a table ""of some sort"". So Schopenhauer is wrong. The power of abstraction frees us from seeing the world as merely what our sensors tell us. The inability to do this is the state of (non-human) animals. '.

Einstein showed that objects move not only from point A to B in spatial dimensions but they also move from point A to B in the temporal dimension (e.g. from now to tomorrow on the ""futureward axis""). So if your unmoveable object is marching through time and aging, then, even if it remains stationary in space, it was *pushed by something* to go through time. (Unless it's travelling at C, where time or distance does not exist). For an object to be immovable, it must not be moving (or can not be moved) *relative* to anything else, rather, everything else must be moving relative to *it*. But everything is moving relative to everything else in an Einsteinian universe and there apparently can not be any such reference frame. Let's pretend the entire universe only consists of two objects, the pusher object and pushee object. With only two points of reference, you can't tell who is winning, since you need a line in the sand to serve as a measurement reference point! Of course, the observer is also a reference point, which means now we have 3 reference points, each doing something and affecting the other or being affected by the other and therefore marching through time - because observation and forces require the exchange of information - (If the immovable object was *not* telling the force to ""back off"" (or repelling it), then the immovable object would be invisible to the point of non-existence and the force would win)! So because time is ticking and because information is being exchanged - even though all three points are not moving *in space relative to each other*, the force wins since it has created a change in the state of the system and has, in effect, pushed the ""immovable"" object *through time*!

Now what is a more elegant solution here; has evolution created qualia so that we may feel the difference of incoming data (which is silly because if the brain already knows the difference between incoming data based on wavelength differences etc, there is no need to assign it further differentiation such as with a specific quality - that's doubling the effort) - or does evolution *discover* (with ever approaching fidelity) the quality of things that already exist?

The result is that many investments regarded as ethical are simply ones that are consistent with some investor's subjective values, be they religious, political, social, environmental etc. An ""ethical fund"" is usually one with a social and political agenda, an attempt to either engineer society via propaganda or to profit off the propaganda a company thinks others believe in. Some people including myself don't believe that the Ethical standard used by these funds/startups is either correct or ethical, and may even often be downright evil!

"The argument: 'I am of your position more or less *but* I'm going to imagine an example where faith, or lack of sensual or experiential evidence is operating, that might be construable (in it's context) as heroic: - a man is running through pitch black darkness in a direction he can't see. All he knows is that he has to ""tap the end wall"" in 60 seconds to save his family. There are obstacles, but he knows he has to run a more or less straight line to have any chance of making it in 60 seconds. So, spurred on and motivated by his irrational faith in his success, he bolts through the darkness, overcoming his fear of hitting into objects, hoping he is running in the direction. Hoping? No, *believing*, for without an all consuming blind belief, his body would slow down from its break neck pace. He has a real chance of reaching the wall in time! Meanwhile, another man who needs evidence to act second guesses his moves, the objects in his path, doubts and is slower for it - and his family dies. Now consider our own (probably similar) positions as proud realists who scorn faith and demand reasons. Were we not young once without philosophy, justifying our actions by a *sense* of what was right and wrong or true and false, and without the power to explain or know explicitly *why*? At that tender age, did we not operate on the principle that ""we don't know the reason now, but we trust, or have *faith*, that there is one, which we will eventually be able to find?"" Faith in oneself is surely an *essential* requirement of the growing mind that *must* have conclusions about the world early on in order to act, but *doesn't* yet need to know how or why those conclusions got there, or if they are right or wrong. There's no time for that! You act as if you are right, on faith, on trust. Then there is another point. Even now as adults, are *you* able to reduce every one of your beliefs to verifiable evidence?

That would be like winning a battle to lose the war, or cutting off your nose to spite your face, or draining the baby out with the bathwater. But it wouldn't have worked anyway - precisely because America is such a rich honeypot of buyers and such a large market, and the the values of capitalism are so entrenched in the American psyche that a higher government penalty would simply mean a higher black market price and financial reward to the distributor/seller. In America (and not so much in other countries perhaps) as risk increases, so does reward/incentive - and the world is full of very poor people willing to take that risk.

""Near universal consensus"" is just another way of saying you should believe it because ""everyone else believes it - except for a few nutters"". Truth by majority or authority is bad epistemology. The truth of free trade relies on facts that are available first hand to the common man - right in front of his eyes. He trades his effort with his neighbours, and learns that when done freely it's to mutual benefit and a gain for all. He can learn that when third parties intervene with force he gets shafted somewhat. He can see the riches of trade all around in shopping centres, in busy cities, on the internet. He can see countries ravaged by war, or that have closed up their borders and suffer as a result. The truth of global climate change however relies on a massive body of facts and (complex) evaluations that are *not* available as first hand experience to the common man. He can not rely on his experience of local weather or local pollution to know or understand the causes of global patterns.

You are like millions and millions of young people who have been taught a type of morality that makes them feel really really bad and really confused. This morality you were taught says that *being selfish is evil*. When you are young, you *want* to be a good person, the best person you can be. So you listen to your parents or your religion for guidance on how to be a good person. And the lesson you learn is that the self-profit motive is evil, that selfishness is evil, that benefitting from life in *any way* means you are evil. (But how unfair is that!) So you try your best to serve others, to help others, to live for others. But you question your motives - are you really doing this for them, or yourself? You feel guilty, because you are doing it ""to be a good person"", which is selfish. Every action you take, you recognize you are benefiting your self, you can't help it, and so you suspect you are evil. And what is evil must die! But you are wrong! This morality (""altruism"") is fundamentally wrong, irrational, contradictory, unfair, evil. It demands everyone serve the happiness of others, yet denies everyone the right to be happy, to pursue their own happiness! If 10 hungry fully logical altruists had a loaf of bread, they'd say ""You are hungrier than I, you take it"", ""No, I'd feel guilty, I can't accept it while you are hungry, you take it"" - and so on - and they would all die - while the bread of life rotted untouched. The horror that is altruism is that it puts real evil doers - thieves and murderers in the same ""evil"" category as people who study or work hard and *earn* and *deserve* their money and happiness.

Just consider all the religious and secular schisms in history. (You could even argue that moral relativism, being as lazy at it is, has less potential to jeopardise public discourse than a strong absolutist position because ""that's just your opinion man"" is effectively bailing out of the conversation, leaving those with a strong stand/position to continue debating.

If it were possible for a fully altruistic person to choose to go to hell so that another could take their place and go to heaven, they would. Naturally this is nuts and psychologically and just logically suspect - because the ultimate act of selflessness is simply to give up all pretense and fall dead, and not move and not think and not feel. Only then you've renounced the self in its entirety. But ultimately our judgment needs to be an objective one - we can't guess or know the layers of psychological delusion in another person, and it doesn't matter what they think or what their subconscious is thinking. Instead, you judge the real values that the person actually chose or gave up. And you decide which value is objectively greater for a human qua being a human. Then it becomes simple. $10,000 vs $100.

An improvement, a fresh and more vigorous start. It's not just our body that ages, but for the vast majority of us our thought patterns, beliefs and values become fixed and calcified too, like a needle trapped in the deepened grooves of an old record player. To survive, life needs to change. And to keep on changing and adapting to keep up with changes in the environment. Sex provides the changes. New life is a blank and slightly modified slate, ready for a fresh imprinting from the present. Older lives have already been imprinted by the past, by that which exists no more. No doubt we inherited death as our destiny from the very beginning of evolution. Modified offspring better survived than their parent. But if the parents were *better* at surviving than their children, then they would be the last in their line, to be picked off one by one by misfortune and accident rather than pre-programmed death. And that was the end of their lineage. Parents without pre-programmed death would eventually compete with their children or children's children down the line - if they won, their lineage would die out, there would be no more change, and they would eventually lose. So evolution invented pre-programmed death, a death from ""natural"" causes, or from ""within"" the living creature, giving it an allotted time that allowed it to persist. A balance that wasn't so long so as to endanger it's progeny, and no so short as to risk not having progeny. To ensure the right amount of change would persist over time. Death was a solution to the problem of ensuring Life would persist. It does seem that humans have the potential to circumvent this evolved law. But to merely persist, to merely keep existing is not enough for life to survive or to be worth living.

"The argument: '""resources are finite = eventual failure of capitalism"" is a fallacy of marxists and children who treat wealth and value as a single pie to be fought over or shared till consumed and used up - while the parents know it's a function of how many they bake. The source of value, the resource that creates value and makes all other resources have value - is the human mind - and what the human mind brings to and can create from whatever exists, regardless of that thing's quantity. And what is considered a natural resource chops and changes throughout history depending on which minds can make use of it. Take the 10 billion J.K Rowling brand. That wealth essentially came *out of her head*. It's now $10b worth of newly created stored energy - that never existed before - which she can unleash (via trade and selling a single piece of paper that says ""The rights to Harry Potter"") by literally sending a rocket to the moon!

I detest vegan piousness as much as the next bacon eater, but shouldn't you allow them this social freedom so that us bacon eaters can retain our own freedom to extol the virtues of meat and/or defend ourselves and fight back? A social taboo against criticizing other people's food choices works against against the majority too. And if meat eaters were the minority at a table, you'd still want them to have a say regarding the menu. But how is it that a minority vegan view has this amazing power to virtue signal and guilt the whole table to order vegan? There must be a social taboo already in place - against a meat eater's defense! Veganism can do this because it's not *really* about food or diet, it's a *moral ideology* that fills western society's ethical vacuum and claims the moral high ground in the absence of any ideological fightback. We shouldn't have let this happen, but we did because we were philosophically unprepared and just wanted to eat in peace at the dinner table goddammit. Perhaps for fear of human heroes, we have anthropomorphized the animal kingdom for our children in our cartoons and movies - and by the time they are teens searching for meaning, right and wrong, empathizing emotionally with existential horror at documentaries that show the abuse of farm animals they will be ripe receptacles to watch a lecture by Gary Yourofsky or learn a Peter Singer argument - and become vegan soldiers.

"The argument: '&gt;Africans, when left to their own devices, are incapable of creating well functioning societies. If true, this points to a *cultural* problem, not a problem with genes or intelligence, because a ""well functioning society"" is the consequence of certain ideas, values and beliefs. It does not point to an inferiority of race and genes, it points to an inferiority of culture. Ideas and values are taught things and learnt things that *are not* reliant on IQ - even a 5 year old child will understand the morality they are being taught not intellectually but intuitively. So the question is; what values are Africans being taught, and what should they be taught? A civilised society only requires the removal of force from that society and the instillation of the value of *individual* private property rights, which means and *end to stealing* and the growth of respect for each other's private property. In my limited understanding, African societies still largely value communal/tribal sharing above and beyond individual property ownership, with an often blurry delineation between ""mine and ""yours"". &gt;IQ IQ - just like physical Strength or Speed - does not cause virtues or vices or morality (or how good a person you are). &gt;History. &gt;Black people, historically, have made no significant societal advancements on their own....would still live in small primitive tribes and little mud huts... The same is true of the Germanic and Celtic Barbarians north of Rome. The ""Western World"" is not a racial or geographical idea, it is a *philosophical* idea (in opposition to an *eastern* idea) - which rests on ancient Greece, Aristotle and his ideas of reason and logic. Today, any country is part of the western world that culturally values reason/logic over faith/feelings/superstitions. That Aristotelian torch was carried briefly by the Middle East during Europe's darker periods. And was given to Japan and China in the 19th century.

Service is *slow* where there is no tipping. But is that ""worse""? That depends on culture. Europe has a culture of ""your table is yours for all night if you want, and we're not going to hurry you to get out before you want to"". People go to restaurants when the want a leisurely meal.

When you get into exotic varieties of either, the difference in complexity disappears, or in some rare cases can shift to the beer (have you ever had Firestone Anniversary 17?

It doesn't *matter* what factors go into the experience of complexity of a good wine, because the complexity is mostly in the mind of the beholder. ABX comparisons don't really tell you anything. If someone experiences complexity in a wine because they think it's expensive and well-rated, they *experience* that complexity, and it's completely valid. Games like dying white wine red are missing the point. The color changes how you experience the wine. If something as simple as dying the wine can change your experience of it entirely, then indeed it *is* more complex, not less. The fact that you can't change the experience of beer as much by dying it is actually a strike against it in the complexity of the subjective experience of drinking it. '.

"The argument: 'Define what ""random"" means to you. Does it mean ""non-deterministic""? Or does it just mean ""chaotic enough that it is impossible (either in theory or practice) to predict""? If you don't believe the universe is non-deterministic, you're not alone, though I think you're wrong. But I won't try to argue that one here, because it's kind of off topic. But ""chaotic enough to be, even in theory, unpredictable""? Everything about evolution fits this bill. The things that cause natural selection (pseudo-random mutations causing cancer, that one particular deer being caught by that one particular lion on that one particular day, etc., etc.) are all random by that definition. And what does it mean for the animal to ""do something to themselves""? Is this something more than expressing the characteristics that their genes give them to you? At which point, we're back to random gene mutations again. Humans have big brains (most likely) because being smarter meant that you survived better, to pass your genes that made you smarter, on to the next generation. It doesn't really matter *how* this happens. Yes, choosing a better mate might make you have better offspring (this is, however, ""random"" in at least one of the senses above), but the intelligence you used to do that developed because of natural selection in the first place. The theory of evolution doesn't say that all change is completely ""random"" in the sense of mutations caused by radiation or something. Sexual selection (animals choosing mates for some trait, enhancing that trait) is widely believed to occur. Now, ultimately, because of the way DNA combines at the molecular level, this does involve a *lot* of ""randomness""... but it's not what one would call ""100% random"". '.

And, whether you want to admit it or not, it is in fact completely impossible that a hadrosaur, as that term is meant, would be living in 16th Century France. All of the evidence we have of the existence of Hadrosaurs shows that they lived in the late Cretaceous Period on an island continent nowhere near there. It is theoretically possible that some distant descendent of hadrosaurs lived at that time... indeed it's moderately likely.

"The argument: 'This sounds like a form of [compatiblism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism). If that's incorrect, please feel free to explain how your view differs from this common metaphysical stance. My argument against Compatiblism as it is usually held by most people is two-fold, both of which are problems with definitions (I am ignostic about this topic): 1) While Compatiblism doesn't necessarily require determinism, most people that argue for it hold that the universe is deterministic. All of our best evidence is that the universe isn't actually deterministic, it just acts that way because lots of random trials with statistical outcomes *look* deterministic. I would argue more that the definitions of free will don't really address this very well. Libertarian free will is almost certainly nonsense. There's no physical mechanism that would accomplish this kind of thing. Similarly, incompatiblist arguments fail because determinism isn't really an accurate description of how things work, except statistically. Overall, if we want to look at free will, we have to define it in a way that makes sense with our knowledge of the laws of physics. 2) Most people define ""free will"" in a way that is really *very* different from the compatiblist definition. In a sense, compatiblism doesn't so much answer the question of free will as it does redefine both ""free"" and ""will"". If something is 100% determined, most people would simply not consider that thing ""free"". If it is 100% random, most people would not consider it ""will"". Compatiblism says ""well, ok, the term doesn't make any sense at all, so we're going to redefine the terms so that they make sense"". And it's ok to do that, but it doesn't really address what most people *mean* by free will. What most people mean by it involves supernatural components that aren't even well defined. What most people mean by ""free will"" is just basically errant nonsense. '. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

"The argument: 'The thing is that *all* our best evidence points towards quantum events being non-deterministic. The only reason the universe *looks* deterministic to our limited senses is that a very large number of random events averages out to something that looks extremely deterministic. This is inevitable, due to the cleverly named ""Law of Large Numbers"". The Central Limit Theorem helps too. Is it possible that there are hidden variables that explain the apparent randomness of QM? Technically, but in order for that to be true, the speed of light would have to not be a barrier to information exchange, because Bell's Theorem mathematically proves that you can't have both locality and realism (which devolves to determinism), even if there are hidden variables, and still measure the results that we have unambiguously measured innumerable times. We've looked for violations of the speed of light limit even more innumerable times, and haven't found them. Special Relativity is one of the most thoroughly proven ideas in science. In any event, your position is called ""incompatiblism"" by people who talk about free will. There are other theories that say that free will is compatible with pure determinism. Honestly, though, I'm quite ignostic on the topic of free will. I don't think I've ever seen anyone define ""free will"" in a coherent enough way so as to even have a discussion about it. E.g. what does it even mean to say that one ""could have chosen differently""? Does it mean that your choice could have been random? Maybe that's ""free"", but how is that ""will""?'.

"The argument: 'The weakest point of your proof is the definition of an ""observer"". In Quantum Mechanics, the term ""observer"" is often misinterpreted as being a conscious/sapient being, but that is completely unnecessary, just as one example of the weakness of this definition. Does an observer have to ""observe"" to meet your requirements? For example, let us suppose that there is a completely closed system, which even in principle no sapient being in the outside universe can observe. Say the inside of a black hole. That sapient non-observer (by any reasonable definition) can make a proposition about what is happening inside the black hole, and that proposition can correspond with the facts (or not) even if it is absolutely impossible for the non-observer to verify that truth. I think it might be correct to say that without a *proposition-maker* there can't be a ""truth"" if you define ""truth"" in this extremely narrow way.

In my college, cheating was an honor code violation that was taken very seriously, and was ""prosecuted"" primarily by student members of the Honor Committee, who not only were known and trusted for their probity, and well supported by the administration, but highly motivated to avoid the development of a cheating-friendly environment for all the reasons you point out.

"The argument: 'Less ignorance doesn't mean less mystery, but quite the opposite. The more you know, the more things there are to wonder about. I think you might want to ask yourself what people actually *do* with all the information they have. The answer for me at least, is seek even more. When I find out about a weird new astronomical phenomenon, or a new disease, or a new picture of giant squid that never had been captured before, it doesn't decrease the mystery of the world, it makes me curious to know even more. And that has been the history of science since basically forever. Basically, I think you're missing the point about mystery. Something can't actually be mysterious until you know something about it. There's nothing mysterious about some teacup floating in space near Mars because we never have discovered one... if we found such a thing, it would open up *tremendous* amounts of mystery and curiosity. People having access to massive amounts of information just relieves their *ignorance*. It doesn't break their curiosity, but rather just piques it. '.

If you're a native English speaker, I think you'll understand immediately the difference between ""gay Paris"" (pah-ree), and ""gay Paris"" (pair-iss). One key element that you're ignoring is context. It's perfectly appropriate to use foreign pronunciations when speaking with people of that native language. In this context, it becomes an issue of respect, rather than of pretentiousness. I will certainly agree that *sometimes* people are being pretentious when they do this. BTW, some other languages *don't* do this. If you listen to native Chinese speakers talk about technical subjects for any length of time, you'll find that their speech is absolutely *peppered* with English words pronounced in an American accent with English intonations.

"The argument: 'So you've agreed that speech can be restricted when it acts like aggression against another person. But speech has other practical consequences besides just aggression. Some speech is more than just simply speech. For example, if you say ""I agree to pay you for that hotel room"", it creates a contract, at the very least an implied one, if not an actual one. If you say to a politician, ""I agree to pay you if you do what I want"" we call that bribery, because politicians accept (via laws that they agree to when the run) restrictions on their right to accept payments (either literal or in-kind) when they sign on to be a candidate. In both of these cases, the *context* of the speech matters. If you jokingly tell your friend that you'll pay him for a hotel room, it doesn't create this kind of contract, because the hotel room isn't his to rent out. If you tell the same friend ""I agree to pay you if you do what I want"" it's not *necessarily* bribery, because your friend hasn't agreed to any kind of societal or individual contract that says he's not allowed to do that. If the ""what I want"" happens to be slipping you some of his company's stationary on the side, though, suddenly it becomes interference in a contract. The problem with expensive documentaries that support particular candidates published during an election campaign is that they have the practical effect of being bribery. The fact that it's implicit rather than explicit doesn't really change this. The same documentary run outside of some election cycle isn't effectively an ""in-kind"" donation to the candidate, because it doesn't have any immediate effect that the politician can benefit from. So... with saying some sentence to your friend, the context changes whether it's simple free speech, or an incitement to fraud, theft, or interference in a contract. Documentaries published in times when they will have a material effect on an election that benefits a candidate in a way that is prohibited are similar. They aren't just speech, they are also effectively bribery.

"The argument: 'The conceptual problem with your question is much more fundamental than you have dismissed in several other comments. If pre-birth you have actual preferences and opinions, then those preferences and opinions will drive your choices in this list. E.g. if I wanted to give birth to a child, I would choose to be female. If I wanted to be a professional track runner, I would choose to be black (all else being equal). If they wish to be a gymnast, they wouldn't select ""tall"". Etc. But if they have no actual preferences or opinions pre-birth then there would be literally no reason at all to choose one over the other. You're hypothesizing a very bizarre set of attributes that I'm pretty sure it's not possible for a conscious being to have, at least based on all the evidence about how consciousness arises.. Furthermore, you're only looking at the positive benefits of many of these options. For example: Asians are statistically more intelligent. Why not choose that? Males have lower life expectancy, why not choose female for that reason? Poor people are statistically happier (yes, that's counterintuitive, but so what)?

"The argument: 'Let's leave out for a moment the purpose that tips actually serve, which is a form of profit sharing that allows restaurants to hire more servers than they need during slow times in order to have them available for busy times, while roughly compensating them for the total amount of work that they have to actually do. Percentage tipping is basically a simplified shortcut for level of service. Let's consider courses. Should you tip the same for an entree as you tip for an appetizer, soup, salad, entree, and dessert? If so, I think you're not compensating the waiter fairly for the amount of service that they provide. But, indeed, that's almost all the difference in prices between differing meals. It's relatively small potatoes to worry about the price of any one of the dishes. The ""percentage"" rule is just a simplified way of calculating this compensation. It needn't always apply, necessarily. Indeed, in many cases, people don't tip the full percentage on their more expensive wine purchases for exactly the reason that it seems out of scope with the difference level of service. But that's because the difference in wine prices is far, far larger than the difference in entree prices. If you want to use a more complicated algorithm, fine. Tips aren't mandatory in any case (the ones that are are called service charges). Of course, your waiter isn't necessarily going to go to all the trouble to figure out if your specific tip fits some algorithm that they can't possibly know, so don't be surprised if your tips end up out of alignment with what they expect. This may well be reflected in your future service. Or not. But ultimately the question you have to ask yourself is ""do you want the server to feel like they've been fairly compensated, or don't you care about that?"". '.

"The argument: 'It's a confusing word. Sorry, some words are just confusing. Quick, what does ""set"" mean? The basic problem is that ""gender"" means something different to different people and in different contexts. That's not really that uncommon. So here: Most times, when transgender people talk about gender, it's my experience talking with them that they are talking about gender identity, and that, yes, this is what body parts feel ""natural"" to them. You feel natural having 5 fingers. If you suddenly and inexplicably had 4, you'd probably still feel like you should have 5. That's pretty easy to understand... but what if for some inexplicable reason, you felt like you should have 6 fingers? And that it felt as weird to you to have 5 fingers as most people would feel if they suddenly had 4, or a weird bifurcated tentacle thing at the end of their arm. Do some people mean gender roles when they talk about this? Sure. Words are flexible. You might have to ask for some clarification of what they mean. They are in a very strange situation, so don't be surprised if they have a hard time explaining it. They're generally doing the best they can. Sometimes ""gender"" means sex. Sometimes it means ""gender roles"". Sometimes it means ""gender identity"" as I described above. Sometimes it means all of the above. Again, what does ""set"" mean? It's not at all unusual for words to have many, and complicated, meanings. That doesn't make the word useless or meaningless, it just means that it depends on context.

The basic fundamental principle of terrorist tactics is that they desire to pit their targets against the moderate members of a group they belong to. Terrorists want the U.S. to associate terrorism with Islam. They want this to be perceived by moderate Muslims as the West and Christianity being at War against Islam, because they know that this is the best way to recruit more followers.

"The argument: 'Ultimately, if everything else stays the same, but everyone in the country gets a degree because it's ""free"", then everyone in the country will end up paying a similar amount in taxes that they would have paid back on their student loans. And you can't discharge taxes in bankruptcy any more than you can get rid of student loan debt... for kind of obvious reasons (the entire point of taxes is that you're forced to pay them). Progressive taxation helps a little... but those Harvard, MIT, and Stanford grads with huge bills are pretty likely to be the ones in the high income brackets paying it. It's pretty likely to even out there as well. Inflation and continuing increases in tuition due to increased demand without increased supply won't be that different from the interest they are paying on student loans today. The reason some countries can do this is that they strictly control university costs, and heavily invest in increasing university capacity. But, of course, we could do that too if we wanted to, without also making college ""free"" for everyone. But while I don't think our universities are *proportionally* that much better than the rest of the world, on an absolute scale they are by far the best in the world (by most metrics, at least 10 of the top 15 schools in the world are in the US... and the others are in Britain (Oxford and Cambridge) which has pretty similar effective tuitions after accounting for financial aid, and Switzerland... which is tiny and very rich). Measurement gets much more varied after this, but in most studies of universities, the U.S. has 40-50 out of the top 100 as well. Yes, they are very expensive, but there is a degree to which you get what you pay for. That controlling of costs that governments do comes at a cost in quality. '.

Let's say I'm a responsible parent and always send my child to school with lunch or money to buy lunch. I would *still* have an interest in having kids fed whose parents didn't do that, because their behavior is going to result in an environment that is worse for my kid.

The two parties are incentive to be as polarizing as possible to pull over as many of those voters as they can. There is no room for middle ground, the party you align with will solve all the problems, and the other party is literally hitler.

One of the points of GoTs though is that conquerors don't always make good rulers. We see this over and over again. Cercei is great at accumulating power, but she's terrible at wielding it. Dany has taken over most of a continent, but her rigid policies have lead to uprisings and multiple attempts on her life. There are a ton of other examples as well. When she arrives in Westeros, she's going to dominate it. It's hers. After she gets the throne though, she's going to have trouble keeping it. She's a conqueror, not a ruler.

I use this example a lot, but consider a case where there is a sick person hooked up to you with some contraption that allows them to use your liver to filter their blood because they are sick and cannot use their own liver. You didn't agree to be hooked up to this person, you just woke up and found yourself here. If they disconnect from your body, they die. However, they do not have a right to use your body unless you consent to it. If you decide you don't consent, you can unhook yourself, and leave. The person dies.

"The argument: '&gt; The reason PC games are becoming shit full of things like DRM is because of pirating. DRM does not seek to prevent piracy. It's purpose is to limit where and how legitimate customers can use the software or media they bought. Anti-piracy measures that get in your way are not the fault of pirates, they are the fault of a combination of poor software engineering and a poor attitude towards customers. That is, companies think that it's so worth it to combat piracy that they degrade the experience of other users in order to prevent piracy. If you feel that anti-piracy measures are ruining games, you should vote with your dollar. Valve along with a few other game companies and many indie developers choose to not include any anti-piracy measures in their games because they recognize they do little good and serve to alienate actual customers. Edit: I suppose it might be worth it to mention that I'm a game programmer who has a fairly extensive collection of pirated games, though they're mostly from the SNES and NES era. Piracy, in my opinion, is just another market factor that companies need to compete with, and a good business will be able to compete with free by offering secondary services that improve the game play experience in a way you can't with pirated games. This is why Steam is so successful even in the face of pirates. '. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

I think it really comes down to how you *want* to define the words, and what definitions are useful to you. When a rock rolls down a hill, it's an entirely deterministic process.

We can prove this by just having a person perform all the tasks a Turing machine needs to be able to do to meet the definition of a Turing machine. Although it is not proven that there is nothing more powerful, we have not discovered any model of computation more powerful than a Turing machine. Sure, it's possible that a brain is some class of computer *more* powerful, but I really see no reason to believe this is the case. The brain is just made up of atoms or quarks or strings or whatever - and these things are just little automatons that follow rules.

Every XBox will have a Kinect, every Wii U game can expect the player to have wiimotes, etc. Controllers are standardized on each system. To play a console game, you buy the game and put the disk in (or just download it off the shop). Done. To play a computer game, you have to make sure you've got good enough specs, even in 2016 developers are going to be making games that push the limits of computers. People who are not tech savvy are turned off by needing to know about computer specs. Depending on what game you buy you might need to make sure you have the right inputs. Some games are designed for controllers, some for Wiimotes, some for Kinect, some for keyboards and mouse, etc. And not all of these input methods are readily available to use on PCs. There's also the issue that the typical home has a separation between their computer which they play on their monitor and the console that they have hooked up to the TV in the family room. Unless you're one of the relatively few people (like me) who hooks his computer directly up to the family room TV, it's going to be irritating to try to play games with local multiplayer. No doubt, all of these issues I've raised with regards to the PC are solvable.

"The argument: '&gt; To me, what the problem really seems to be is that they'll start charging companies like Netflix and YouTube for the bandwidth they use. And this sounds like ten pounds of ""not my problem"". They can already charge them for the bandwidth they use. If you use more bandwidth, ISPs are free to charge you more for using more. Just like I get charged more for using more water, and that one day where the water line broke and water spilled out by the gallon I got charged a ton since I used up a ton of water. What the water company can't do is charge be based on how I'm using the water. They can't charge me twice and much for drinking water compared to toilet water - it's all the same water. ISPs want to be able to charge more for different kinds of data, but bits are just bits. It doesn't matter what they carry. Furthermore, ISPs in most places are monopolies, and companies like comcast have their own competing cable TV service. They would love to be able to price gouge Netflix to drive prices up, which makes their cable TV much more competitive. This is not free market competition. If it were I'd generally be in favor of letting the competitors duke it by making better products, but this is not one of the cases were we can leave it to the market. '.

"The argument: '&gt; Being able to print guns creates a precarious situation in which it is difficult to truly regulate and track the production of firearms. Granted its lower lethality potential, these printer-made guns can still kill and it's already been proven that is difficult to 'ban' firearm blueprints off sites such as piratebay and whatnot. Regulations to stop dangerous things from being printed will simply not be effective. This honestly doesn't seem like a big deal to me. In total, there were 32,163 gun related deaths in in 2011. By comparison, there were 32,367 car related deaths in that same year (statistics pulled from [here](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-states) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year)). They're pretty close, but we allow cars on the road despite their deadliness. We allow people to own and operate cars though because cars are *extremely* useful. 3D printing has an absolutely astronomical number of uses. They have a potential to do huge amounts of good. Sure, some people will misuse them and make weapons, but how many people will use them that way, and how many additional deaths will they cause? I personally don't see them causing so many deaths compared to the amount of good they'll do that it's worth regulating them. At least not until we have some data on how many people are actually committing murders with these weapons at least. &gt; Public use of 3D printers, outside of work environments, is excessive and does not need to exist for any innovative reason in society. The majority of the benefits of owning such a printer are based not on its utility but its novelty. You could say the same thing about any number of inventions before the caught on with the public. I'd pull up a bunch youtube videos of some of the amazing thigns people have been able to do with 3D printers, but I'm at work right now.

Why are we spending any money at all on anything but the most deadly disease in the world. We shouldn't be putting some of our money toward breast cancer and some of our money toward lung cancer, we should find out which is the most deadly and put all our effort and money and time into that, until it's solved! I'm being facetious of course, but that's generally the kind of attitude your advocating. Lets run with the disease example for a moment. Do you think that every dollar we put toward a given disease has the same impact on helping find new treatments or cures? It doesn't - after you get to a certain point you start getting hit by [marginal utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility). That is, after you've reached a certain amount of funding, each additional dollar is less useful than the last. This doesn't just apply to money though, it applies to all sorts of things. There are a ton of issues in the world. We can't all put our effort toward one single cause. It's up to each person to decide which causes are important to them (and the list of important causes is going to be in a different order for each person) and then to act on those. That said, even small amounts of sexism can have huge impacts. As luck would have it, I just had to go through a short video about various -isms for my job, and they ran an experiment I thought was interesting. They created a hypothetical company with a huge number of employees and various ranks of employees from newbies all the way to executives. In this simulation, each person was randomly assigned a gender and a competence level between 0 and 100. Every cycle, there would be a certain attrition rate of existing employees, and employees from lower levels would be promoted up to fill their spots based on who was most competent. They ran this experiment until all existing employees had been quit and replaced by new employees, and then looked at the statistics. Under normal circumstances, the gender ratios remain roughly the same, allowing for some statistical jitter.
