You're probably jumping to conclusions and he may be a nice guy, but there is a pile of people to choose from, why take a risk? So hiring is all about the right fit and balancing risk. People who cannot portray themselves online in whatever we deem is professional online, get labeled as risky. Whether it should or should not happen isn't the question, it is happening. So those riskier people end up not getting job offers as often. You can scream about how it's unfair, but you can also understand why it happens, and understand there are costs associated with hiring people that cannot be recouped.

Even if we leave the government out of it and leave it to free markets to legally develop these recreational drugs, then pharma companies would have to spend huge amounts of money researching, and then testing these drugs to prove there are no long term effects.

Humans only use what they know to make decisions. Computers are hypothetically capable of observing the environment and using all the information available to make decisions. I would stress to you that the human brain is not special. There's nothing intrinsically unique about being human. Your brain is electricity, neurons, blood, and glia, nothing more.

If 7 billion people's worth of consumed animal products were to just go away, there's no telling that there would be an innate benefit to everyone being vegan. The reasons you listed, are at best theoretical, with the exception of minimizing the suffering of animals, which is even more subjective since not everything we eat can feel pain and suffer to begin with (Shrimp, Lobster etc.) For starters, even if we were to uselessly butcher all of our domesticated meat animals down to a reasonable level, there's no telling how their behavior in the wild would influence every other habitat at this point. It's also very possible that they would become an invasive species throwing other biomes into disarray through their untethered consumption of flora and fauna for any instance where they are effectively apex predators. Then there's also the aspect of introducing new large animals into a domestic society. Imagine living out in the country and having to worry about wild cattle getting upset with and killing you, in a chance encounter. This has the potential to cascade into the housing market and effect the economy in ways unrelated to the job market. There's also the issue of filth to consider. Right now we have all these dirty domestic animals contained in a select few locations. We also treat them for disease. if left to run wild they could have unprecedented effects on things like cockroach populations, or mosquito outbreaks both of which are our problem.

There are people who ""gamble"" and its about exploiting your edge. I count cards so I know when the odds are in my favor and size my bet accordingly, I am exploiting my edge. On the other hand, exploiting your edge is what smart people do. When I apply for a job, I tell them I have a degree and that gives me an edge. I tell funny joke, make people laugh and they like me more than this other guy, so I am exploiting my edge. &gt; What bothers me is that these people are being rewarded greatly for this activity, and they aren't really contributing to society.

"The argument: '&gt; I feel like UBI has become a rallying point for alot of people who have grown up in a generation that has demonized welfare This is one of the strongest arguments for basic income. Welfare is demonized, but it is not just the current generation which has demonized it. A paper in which this in the Manitoba annual income experiment from the 1970's. It was found that many people who joined in on the experiment did so for two reasons. First, it created a sense of financial security, and second, that it was not welfare. Welfare is a stigmatized idea in which the people who need it may not use it because of the stigmatization which comes from it not being universal. The point of this is to create a fair system. If everyone receives the money, no one can be stigmatized for accepting it. As such, basic income is superior in this sense to welfare in which only those who qualify are able to benefit from it. A big problem with welfare is that it does not provide the people receiving it with the ability to use it as necessary. If you are provided with $180 in food stamps per month, but you only need $140, you are losing access to $40 per month which you could use toward other necessary expenses. You are limited in how you can use the money you receive when you are on welfare. Basic income though is just a lump sum of money which can be used for anything. This means that when your car has trouble in 10 months and is going to required $400 to fix, that $40 you saved every month in your food budget can be used to pay for it.'.

Anyway, we can establish that whoever controls the army can seek his own profit and interest, and really you find this in all societies where in some cases generals have become dictators and elsewhere democracies officially using force to protect their interest. So whoever uses the army nearly always use it for their interest at some point, the case of Trump or even Obama before him isn't different than for anyone who controls military force. Although it has to be said that the soldier's condition has improved since all the wars before, a well equipped military with professional soldiers is something else than the meat used in WWI and WWII where the soldiers where people of everyday. Furthermore military casualities cost a lot more than before for the sole reason that when a soldier dies, it's a professionnal who died, this incentivise the strategy to force secure the people in the army contrary to other times. The army is also an incredible internationnal tool, the UN peacekeeping forces have in general really good result to prevent violence in troubled areas.

In a democracy, its purpose is to allow humans to express their displeasure with government in an effective way so that it doesn't turn into a tyranny. We *do* use ""evidence"" to decide what is done in government. We use polls, we use voting, we use many mechanisms for objectively deciding what the will of the public is. And the reason we do this is that revolutions are *way* more destructive to everyone and everything than the government saying sufficiently in step with what the public wants that they don't revolt. What the will of the public is is *never* going to be decided entirely by science, unless society changes dramatically, and even then you have the problem that the vast majority of people, by the nature of bell curves and the law of large numbers, are always going to be ""behind"" the scientific consensus of the intellectual elite.

First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection. &gt;I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured. https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.],0.0,False,False,Entertainment,Benevolence: dependability
"The argument: 'While I agree that certain recreational drugs have to (and will likely be) legalized, what say you to things like opiates, crack, cocaine, etc. that all have detrimental effects to health, cognitive function, come with addiction, etc. Shit like weed is fine, and should absolutely be legalized right away. There are almost no detrimental effects involved. But opiates can be horrible, hell, even prescription drugs can be abused, and our society generally wants its people to be healthy and un-addicted to narcotics, because that's a drain on funds. Not saying that the war on drugs isn't (it's a bloated waste of money and lives). To give a personal example, a girl from school was addicted to heroin after being introduced to opiates for a long time and her life suffered from it. She then (allegedly) abused legal prescription drugs that were meant to kill her addiction, which resulted in her death. Perhaps decriminalization, but legalization?

"The argument: 'The way you solve this is by giving a test in which the average score is a 50, then applying a curve. You just want a good distribution of scores without a ceiling effect. It doesn't really matter if the end grades are compressed into the As and Bs through a curve or if they are actually distributed into there. You want an exam where no one gets a 100 or 0, and most fall in the middle. What really matters is the student's z score (or percentile)- honestly this would be more useful to report. In terms of entering grades, if the student is doing well *enough*, there's an expectation that they will get a high grade. So- what you can do is curve so that a 90 is actually pretty bad, you can give that student feedback to bring their performance up, but the student doesn't become screwed due to a bad-looking grade. I realize it's bizarre but my point is that the way grades are used doesn't quite match with your model anymore. '. Question: Which value category does the argument belong to?

Illegals flood the market with cheap labor. Without illegals driving the wages down employers would have to pay a better wage for low level jobs and thus everyone would make more (supply/demand). About 50% of Californian inmates are Hispanic. I don't know the illegal percent off the top of my head but you can guess it's substantial. It costs 30-50 thousand a year to keep someone in prison. There would not need to be a big round up of illegals. Simply by crucifying a few businesses who hire illegals you could scare other places into firing their illegals. Make stiff penalties for hiring illegals and the cost/benefit stops working out. Opportunity dries up. One free plane ticket or bus ride (whichever is cheaper) home on tax payer expense. The wall could be paid for out of Mexican foreign aid. Instead of sending them a shit load of money every year we send them a shitload of money minus the cost of the wall/upkeep.

But if the drinking age was 18 than any 15 year old would simply have to go up to a senior and ask them to buy them alcohol with a fee. I think we all also know that 18 year olds would do this as they are to young to realize how young 15 year olds are, and how dangerous it is for them to drink. Instead if we lower it to 19 than highschoolers will have all of the same problems that they previously did getting alcohol.

"The argument: 'Context: I'm a staffer on a music blog which has traditionally been pretty metal-centric, and I don't generally listen to metal. I think that when people talk about ""I can't understand what they're saying,"" that's usually not all they're objecting to. You bring up some points like that, and there are more: Ariana Grande is generally unintelligible, most Sean Paul listeners don't understand Jamaican Patois, non-Spanish-speakers can still get down to reggaeton. I think what makes metal different is that it's often an abrasive genre. Obviously, that's not all of it - symphonic, progressive, whatever else - but a lot of people's exposure is through tech death and grindcore that they occasionally hear when their friends are making fun of ""cookie monster music."" I know very few people who complain about Death or Carnivore because they can't understand what the singers are saying - I hear them complain because they're not used to thrash. Look at it this way: if you'd never listened to hip-hop before, and somebody showed you Danny Brown's newest album, you'd probably be turned off by its power. You might struggle for things to concretely latch on to as to why you dislike it, and you might pick his voice as a major factor. That might be true, but it's certainly not all of it. Basically, people who complain about metal are usually just using the lyrics as a crutch because they might not have the musical language to describe what is so viscerally off-putting about it. Often it's hard to put gut reactions into words, and I think that if anybody complains because of the lyrics (or lack thereof), they're probably complaining about something more - the way they're delivered, the instrumental backing, the like.

To illustrate the problem, let's look at how trivially easy it is to come up with a story explaining why women actually have a *finer* sense of ""honor"" than men do: If there is selective pressure on men to behave honorably toward one another, it must be a secondary effect of the more primary selective pressure on women to be competent judges of honorable behavior in the first place. After all, natural selection only operates on traits that are relevant to a creature's reproductive viability. A man's ability to conform to a given code of conduct only increases his reproductive fitness to the extent that it makes him more attractive in the eyes of his prospective mates.

"The argument: 'Which Grande Armee versus which Army of the Potomac? The French Republic/Empire was at near continuous warfare from 1792 to 1815. That's 23 years experience against a large variety of foreign armies with different tactics, arms and over a wider variety of terrain versus a 5 year old army fighting the same single enemy back and forth over the same terrain. If the Army of the Potomac was forced to fight the Confederates, the Canadians, the Mexicans and the British from 1860 to 1883, they would be a formidable foe. It's your assertion that discipline and leadership would win over technology. Given equal time, what evidence do you have that Le Grande Armee of 1815 would be considerably more disciplined or better lead than the Army of Potomac 1883? I think compelling evidence could be found in the Civil War itself where the Confederates were better lead with a larger portion of West Point grads and experienced Mexican War officers, not to mentioned a very large lead in cavalry officers (Napoleans use of cavalry being a point you make). Better generalship, better cavalry and better morale and purpose amongst the line troops and Lee could still only get to the point where Armistead was shot down at the breech in the wall on the third day of Gettysburg.

"The argument: 'I am not a Christian, but I'm not exactly a layman when it comes to Christian theology and apologetics. I'll do my best to present you with my answer as a Christian would. But still, take this with a grain of salt. The word that your translation is translating as ""pure"" would be better translated as ""tested"", implying that you can, in a sense, test anything that claims to be divinely inspired scripture to see if it is or not. I'm not going to get into what that testing is because there isn't a definitive answer (That's why Catholics have their cannon which is different to the Protestant Cannon, which is different from the Orthodox Cannon). But the point is that if something passes the test, it is scripture, and if it is scripture there is no problem with it being included. Proverbs 30:6 is a clear reference back to Deuteronomy 4:2 ""You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you."" In this passage Moses is relaying messages from God to the Israelites. Notice how the commandment is ""do not add or take away from it"". God here is not stating that you should never state your opinion or refrain from discussion because doing so would not be adding or taking away from scripture. You would only be adding or taking away if you were claiming that your opinion was divinely inspired, or claiming that your edited version of a verse was divinely inspired on the same level as the Bible. You probably noticed that I always used the phrase ""divinely inspired"" instead of something along the lines of ""the word of God."" as it is never claimed that scripture is a direct copy of God's words, but that God instead inspired the authors of scripture to use their own words to convey his message(As opposed to the Quoran, which is believed by musilms to be God's own words that Muhammad purely wrote down).

As such, the argument he makes is one that centers around real world applications and results, not an an abstract right to free speech consequences be damned. Mill makes three core points about why the silencing of an opinion with which one disagrees is a bad idea. * **You don't know whether the idea you hold up as true could be wrong.** We aren't infallible. It is very, very, very unlikely this is true of the people on subs like coontown. But is it totally impossible? No. * **Even if the ideas on the other side are wrong, they may contain an element of truth.** I think this is where the comparison to something like climate change is apt. The fact of vocal criticism has, on several occasions, pointed out meaningful flaws in climate science that might not otherwise have come to light. Moreover, even if the central premises of climate change existing, being caused by CO2 and human emissions thereof are not in material dispute, that is not the end of the question. There is legitimate uncertainty over the magnitude of change in temperature in respect to CO2 concentration, which is a big question in respect to the degree of justified human response. * **Even if the ideas of the other side are *completely* wrong, contesting them has value.** If something becomes received wisdom that can't ever be debated or challenged, in many cases it will be poorly understood by those advocating for it. We see this in respect to many popular political dogmas today, where people will profess to support free speech, and then support all sorts of censorship. Saying ""I support X"" without ever engaging in a debate on the question with an actual opponent making their best arguments will produce at best a lukewarm version of X.

This is quite typical for industrial equipment. You've seen it forever in the restaurant industry, where failed restaurants see their equipment auctioned at a fraction of the ""new"" price.

But the US still maintains sovereignty over the land. &gt;the concrete manufactures being owned by German companies, when our highway infrastructure needs to be repaired we have to pay them. This doesn't matter nearly as much as you'd think, especially since it's not like a new concrete company can't be founded. And the ""German"" company probably has tons of American shareholders too if it's publicly traded. The US economy is unlikely to collapse because it produces real goods and services that people want. The US manufactures a ton of stuff, produces a ton of housing, and provides a ton of services. Millions of people are doing real meaningful work which produces valuable things for Americans and others. As long as people continue wanting stuff, and America keeps making stuff, the economy can proceed. As well, there's a lot of social, political, physical, and economic infrastructure that keeps the American economy going. For instance, let's say I own a dairy farm. To run well, I need to get my milk to market fast, because milk spoils. I also want to pasteurize my milk so it's safe. So for my milk to get sold to consumers, it needs to get from my cows into a tank at my farm, into a refrigerated truck, to a processing facility where it is pasteurized and put in consumer containers, then on another refrigerated truck to a grocery store, where it needs to be kept refrigerated, then someone buys it.

The Charter is written in clear and unambiguous language. Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in elections for the Commons. The charter was written in living memory. It is not so ancient that we must analyze centuries old legal texts to know what was meant. The use of the terms ""every"" and ""citizen"" have their plain meaning in the English language. If this incredibly clear provision cannot mean what it says on its face, it makes the idea of constitutional rights in Canadian law a farce.

The statue is not a memorial dedicated to his victims, but instead glorifies him on horseback as a hero. The statue exists there for a reason. That reason is to send the following message to any black person with the gumption to walk to the University of Tennessee and seek an education: You are not welcome here. That message is absolutely heard by black students at the university when they walk by this statue. While of course people are tougher than that, and a mere casting of bronze will not dissuade them from bettering themselves, it is still something which can have a demoralizing and dissuading effect, especially at the margin.

Education is a service provided to the people being educated. It gives them new skills, knowledge, experiences, and connections. It has beneficial effects on others as well, but the large majority of the benefit goes to the specific people who were educated. &gt;If education is not the primary objective of an educational institute, the institute may very well jeopardize it in hopes of making more money. How is this different from other businesses? The primary objective of a farmer is to make money, which they do by selling food they grow. A school can do the same. Indeed, if they want to make money long term, they're better off generally providing good education.

Now we're getting to the nitty gritty of why most private for-profit colleges in the US are terrible. And they are terrible. For profit colleges exist because the US government will give large amounts of money to any US citizen with a pulse for college. The tuition they charge is generally exactly enough to maximize the aid a poor person can get from the government (loans+grants).
